== Requirements

* Ruby on Rails 1.1
* Iconv
* Net::LDAP for Ruby (for LDAP authentication)
* a database (see compatibility below)
* (recommended) Apache/Lighttpd with FCGI support 

Supported databases:

* MySQL (tested with MySQL 5)
* PostgreSQL (tested with PostgreSQL 8.1)
* Oracle (tested with Oracle 10g)
* SQL Server (tested with SQL Server 2005)
* SQLite (tested with SQLite 3)

== Upgrade

Due to major database changes, there is no migration support from beta 0.2.0.
Next releases (0.3.0+) will be provided with upgrade support.


== Installation

1. Uncompress program archive:
   tar zxvf <filename>
   
2. Create an empty database: "redmine" for example

3. Configure database parameters in config/database.yml
   for "production" environment (default database is MySQL)

4. Create the database structure. Under application main directory:
   rake migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
   It will create tables and default configuration data

5. Insert default configuration data in database:
   rake load_default_data RAILS_ENV="production"
   This step is optional, as you can define your own configuration 
   (roles, trackers, statuses, workflows, enumerations) from sratch

6. Test the installation by running WEBrick web server:
   ruby script/server -e production   
  
   Once WEBrick has started, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/
   You should now see the application welcome page

7. Use default administrator account to log in:
   login: admin
   password: admin

8. Setup Apache or Lighttpd with fastcgi for best performance.


== Configuration

A sample configuration file is provided: "config/config_custom.example.rb"
Rename it to config_custom.rb and edit parameters.
Don't forget to restart the application after any change.


config.action_mailer.server_settings: SMTP server configuration
