It should be noted that I am receiving emails using pop and the patch in =
Issue #2420 but I don't think the problem lies with this.

When I try and send emails to the redmine server with Japanese =
characters in them it appears to work apart from the pattern matching.

For example if I send an email with the following keywords.

Type: =1B$B3+H/=1B(B
