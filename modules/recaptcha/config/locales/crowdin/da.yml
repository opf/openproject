        reCAPTCHA is a free service by Google that can be enabled for your OpenProject instance. If enabled, a captcha form will be rendered upon login for all users that have not verified a captcha yet. <br/> Please see the following link for more details on reCAPTCHA and their versions, and how to create the website and secret keys: %{recaptcha_link} <br/> HCaptcha is a Google-free alternative that you can use if you do not want to use reCAPTCHA. See this link for more information: %{hcaptcha_link} <br/> Cloudflare Turnstile™ is another alternative that is more convenient for users while still providing the same level of security. See this link for more information: %{turnstile_link}
