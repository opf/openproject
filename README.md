## Repository

This repository contains several main branches:

* `dev`: The main development branch. We try to keep it stable in the sense of all tests are passing, but we don't recommend it for production systems.
* `stable/<version>`: Contains the latest stable release for a specific version. We recommend to use this for production use. Example: `stable/4.1`.
