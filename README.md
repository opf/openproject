## Installation

There is an [installation guide](https://www.openproject.org/projects/openproject/wiki/Installation) and a [reference of configuration options](doc/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Repository

This repository contains two main branches:

* `dev`: The main development branch. We try to keep it stable in the sense of all tests are passing, but we don't recommend it for production systems.
* `stable`: Contains the latest stable release that we recommend for production use. Use this if you always want the latest version of OpenProject.

## Contact

OpenProject is supported by its community members, both companies and individuals. There are different possibilities of getting help:

* OpenProject [support page](https://www.openproject.org/support)
* E-Mail Support - info@openproject.org

## Contributing

In case you find a bug or need a feature, please create a [new work package on openproject.org](https://www.openproject.org/projects/openproject/work_packages).

If you want to contribute code, feel free to create a pull request on GitHub. Unfortunately we'll have to ask you to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.openproject.org/projects/openproject/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement), but you can do that electronically so this shouldn't be too much pain.

You can find more details on the OpenProject Community [contribution page](https://www.openproject.org/projects/openproject/wiki/Contribution).

## Community
