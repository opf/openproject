4 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * no-console:
    - Custom console methods, if they exist, will no longer be allowed.
  * brace-style:
    - ESLint's brace-style will check all tokens.
  * eqeqeq:
    - Option "smart" allows for comparing two literal values, evaluating the value of typeof and null comparisons.
  * no-underscore-dangle:
    - Leading or trailing underscores (_) on identifiers will now be forbidden.

1 rule is not known by tslint-to-eslint-config to have an ESLint equivalent:
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "whitespace".
