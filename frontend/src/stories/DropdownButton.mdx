# Dropdown button

> Example: Filter button with a badge value of 3.

## Description

The dropdown button is a special type of button with a permanent down arrow on the right edge (suggesting further actions) and an optional badge. 

## Behaviour

Clicking on a dropdown button generally opens the dropdown menu, or a drop modal. When the menu or modal is open, clicking on the button again closes it.

> Example: A more button that opens a dropdown menu

In some (rarer) cases, it can open a panel. An example of this is the Filter button.

## Options

The badge is optional and can hold a number from 0 to 99. After 99, the number simply reads "99+".
