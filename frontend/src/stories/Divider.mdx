# Divider

A divider is a non-interactive visual element that allows for better grouping, organisation and hierarchy of elements on a page or a modal.

The divider should only be used when the absence of such a separation can lead to a view looking too busy or unstructured. 

## Behaviour

The divider is not interactive. 

The divider can either be full-width (in the [Modal Dialogue](#) header, for example) or span only a part of the width of the parent (in the activity split screen).

This is determined by the parent element within which the divider is contained.

Divider are usually placed horizontally, although they can also be placed  vertically.

## Options

A divider can be soft or strong. The correct one to use depends on the structure and contrast of surrounding elements:

**Soft**

1 px, Grey-5 (#E0E0E0)

<Canvas of={DividerStories.Soft} />

**Strong**

1px, Grey-4 (#CCCCCC)

<Canvas of={DividerStories.Strong} />

_Example: In the work package details view, the main three-way split (top header, left-side description, right-side split screen) is done using strong dividers, but on the Activity tab, dates are separated with soft ones._
