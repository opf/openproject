# Action Bar

> Example of action bar in a modal

The action bar is generally used at the bottom of modals to present the user with a set of actions. These actions are often relative to choices or selections made in the containing modal. 

The most common choices are "Save/apply" and "Cancel".  At least one button (Cancel) is the absolute minimum.

## Composition

The action bar is composed of:

**Button set**
These are a set of buttons that form the main action choices presented to the user. Although a two-button set is most common, there can be a maximum of three buttons (see “[Options](#)” below).

**Side option (optional)**
The side option allows for a third action (usually a checkbox, but can also be a button, a toggle or any other control). Ideally, the text should be clear and concise.

## Variants

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    {{ component: SbActionBarExample }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

By default:
- the primary button set is on the right side of the action bar
- the side option on the left
- the bar has a grey background

There are however alternative variants:

**Left buttons**

> Example

The button set can be moved to the left, placing the side action on the right. This should be used sparingly and only if absolutely necessary.

**Transparent background**

> Example

The transparent background is useful for when having the action bar in grey (default) does not work visually. The transparent version will simply take the background colour of the element in which it is contained, usually white.

## Options

**Side options**

> Example without side option

The side option is, as the name suggests, optional.

**More buttons**

> Example with three buttons: Watch, Mark as read, More

The action bar can also be composed of up to three action buttons. Should there be more than three actions to be made available to the user, the third button will be a “More” button opens a drop-down with additional options. 

## Behaviour

At the very minimum there should be one action, ideally two: a primary action like ‘Save’ or ‘Delete’ and a secondary action like ‘Cancel’.

When the action bar is use as a toolbar with more three buttons (or with a “More” button), all actions can be secondary.

## Line breaks and wrapping

When the text is too long, the button set will remain in one line, and the side option (if present) will move to a new line. 

If the text in the side option is too long, that will itself also wrap in mutliple lines.

## Margins, Padding and Styling

The action bar normally no external margin and usually spans the full length of the parent element.
 
It has 16px left/right padding and 12 px top/bottom padding, with 16 px spacing between the two buttons in the button set.
