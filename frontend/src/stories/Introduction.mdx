# Design System

At OpenProject, we use a design system to help ensure that our design delivers a consistent experience to users. The system describes the styles, components and patterns that come together to build the foundation for a consistent user experience. To do this, we provide documentation explaining how each element should be used, the different states, variations and options it offers, along with code examples.

Our goal is to reach a point where every view in OpenProject is built with our design system principles and patterns in mind. However, we are aware that reaching this goal will take time for a tool as complex and layered as OpenProject.

As such, the design system is still in its infancy and will grow with each release.

## Purpose (what it is and what it's not)

This Storybook-based design system documentation only seeks to describe the actual reusable components; it does not seek to document features where these components are used.

**The purpose of the design system is to:**

- Ensure that OpenProject has a beautiful, usable and delightful design
- Improve consistency and predictability by defining standards that are reused or extended when there is a need for deviations or alternate versions
- Improve quality (a component that is reused is likely to have gone through more testing and adjustment with each reuse and testing cycle)
- Make design assets easier to maintain (change once to change all)
- Improve accessibility by taking accessibility requirements into account when designing components and patterns

**The purpose of this document is to:**

- Maintain a singular reference on what reusable components and patterns look like, how they behave and what options they provide
- Allow product designers and front-end developers to have a shared understanding of how these common elements are designed and how/when they should be used
- Provide quality assurance personnel a common base of reference when testing features that use these reusable components and patterns (and there is a doubt about an unnecessary deviation)
- Give developers important context about available components and how to use them. We want to enable both team and community members to compose and develop complex interfaces easily, preventing fragmentation and technical debt where possible.

**This document does not:**

- Define every single component in OpenProject
- Define specific features or implementation details
- Define how things *should* look like; the stories contained here will only describe things as they are currently implemented
- Define possible exceptions or variations made within a feature (if necessary)
- Seek to serve as a central documentation for QA testing of features
- Seek to be exhaustive at any point; it will remain a living document that require maintenance as changes are made


## SPOT

Our design system is referred to simply as "OpenProject Design System".

You will often see the `spot-` prefix used in code; this is primarily to distinguish newer refactored components from older elements that have the `op-` prefix.

## Approach

OpenProject is a complex, powerful tool. One of its key strengths is its customisability and its ability to adapt to a range of different needs. This includes complex filtering options, custom types and statuses, custom fields and a wide range of options to configure views and work package forms.

Nevertheless, it is very important that OpenProject be intuitive for new users who might not necessarily need that complexity, or indeed be overwhelmed by it.

Our design approach aims to strike the right balance between powerful and accessible with a two-tiered approach: apply sane defaults and present the most common options, and allow advanced users the option (via an additional click) to customise and fine-tune.

## The UX of Open Source

As an open source project with a considerably long history and a large number of contributors, different parts of OpenProject have evolved at different paces, sometimes with completely different technology. Similar components are sometimes implemented somewhat differently in different parts of the software, and there are even multiple implementations of the same basic design.

This is quite normal for a large open-source project that has not had a dedicated design team for most of its conception.

One of the goals of the design system is to introduce more coherence and introduce a more modern design language. Whilst we would naturally prefer to be able to update everything at the same time and push the new design system to the entire software, we recognise the need for a more pragmatic approach. The design system will be rolled out in phases, with a careful study of the consequences of updating each component or pattern, and the potential dependencies that will be affected.

_We recognise that UI/UX has not always been the highest priority for open-source projects. This is somewhat understandable given how open source projects have relatively fewer design resources dedicated to it than commercial products. Our goal is to do our part to improve that situation as much as we can and document our process._
