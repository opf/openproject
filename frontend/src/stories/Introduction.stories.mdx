# OpenProject design system

This is the Storybook for the OpenProject design system. Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context. That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `stories` directory to learn how they work.
