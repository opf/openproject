// The attribute groups for work packages are a bit different thant on other pages:
//
// In summary, we get the following:
//
// Parent < 800px: 1 Column view where only the long text fields have labels on top
// Parent > 800px: 2 Column view where all fields have left-right labels, and long text fields span both columns
//
// More specifically:
//
// Requirements for the attribute sections in the WP view
//   * Number of columns: min 1, max 2.
//   * Min-width: 400px, max-width: not wider than the parent.
//   * When two-columns are shown, each column has 50% width of the parent.
//   * We cannot use breakpoints, since the width of the parent can be changed
//     dynamically by sliding the sidemenu or split view.
//   * Some attributes span 2 columns, like long text fields.
//   * Labels should be left-right, except for long text fields when the layout
//     is in single-column mode.
//   * Labels should be a fixed 140px wide, all having the same width
