# Form Field

Form fields are a smart wrapper around input fields. Form fields handle labels, validation messages, help texts, and
extra actions around an input field.

## Basic usage

Form fields work with `ng-content` a lot, which we call `slot` in SPOT. There are four slots in which content can be
fitted:

1. `input` holds the input. It can be a text input or select dropdown, or anything else that is not a
   selection toggle.
2. `help-text` holds the attribute help text. To achieve separation of concerns, if you want to show an attribute help
   text this is where the `attribute-help-text` component goes.
3. `errors` holds validation errors.
4. `description` holds a short description of the input field. Oftentimes these are short, helpful guidelines about how
   or what to input into the field.
5. `action` holds extra input actions. Most often, these are `button` elements styled as a `spot-link` that allow the user to
   perform an action related to the input.

Some of these require adding an extra class on that element, so watch the examples carefully!

## Adding an input

Use `slot="input"` to select the input element:

<Canvas of={FormFieldStories.InputSlot} />

## Adding a description

Use `slot="description"` to select the input element:

<Canvas of={FormFieldStories.DescriptionSlot} />


## Adding a help text

Use `slot="help-text"` to select the `attribute-help-text` component:

```html
<spot-form-field label="Form field with help text">
  <spot-text-field slot="input"></spot-text-field>
  <attribute-help-text
    slot="help-text"
    class="spot-form-field--help-text"
  ></attribute-help-text>
</spot-form-field>
```

The example above cannot currently be rendered in Storybook, because the `attribute-help-text` component requires the 
API to be available. They are in use in the project and work package dynamic form. So if you add an attribute help text,
they will show up there.

## Handling validation

SPOT works best with reactive forms. If you have a `FormControl` for your input, `spot-form-field` will be able to
figure out the validation state automagically.

Use `slot="errors"` to set validation errors. You can set multiple errors independently by all giving them the `slot`
attribute.

As you can see, by default validation messages will only be shown on submit. You can change this behavior by changing
the `showValidationErrorOn` input to the `spot-form-field` component.

The `required` input only makes sure the asterisk at the end of the label is shown, it does not add any validation to
the form or input.

## Adding extra input actions

Form field actions allow you to add extra action buttons to the context of an input field.
