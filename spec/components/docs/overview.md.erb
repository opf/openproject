This is an example page. If it has a `.md.erb` file extension its
contents will be run through a Markdown parser/renderer before display.

Fenced code blocks are fully supported and will be highlighted appropriately.

ERB can be used in here.
The template will be rendered **before** being parsed as Markdown.

You can can access data about the page using the `@page` variable.
The title of this page is "<%= @page.title %>".
