# The following aliases are defined so that we can write
# `expect_it { to match /rgx/ }` instead of
# `it { should match /rgx/ }` to be more consistent with the new expect syntax.

  # rspec-rails 3 will no longer automatically infer an example group's spec type
  # from the file location. You can explicitly opt-in to the feature using this
  # config option.
  # To explicitly tag specs without using automatic inference, set the `:type`
  # metadata manually:
  #
  #     describe ThingsController, type: :controller do
  #       # Equivalent to being in spec/controllers
  #     end
