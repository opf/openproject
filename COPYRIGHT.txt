OpenProject NIssue Plugin

This plugin adds a internal API to OpenProject, other plugins may build upon.
It enables plugin code to enhance the issue form or build custom issue forms
based on a common ground. This would not be possible with the default ERB-based
forms, that are used throughout OpenProject.
