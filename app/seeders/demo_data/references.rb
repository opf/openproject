    # Turns ##<tag>:<ref_name> into a link to the referenced object, and
    # ##<tag>.id:<ref_name> into its record id.
    #
    # - `<tag>` can be one of `query`, `sprint`, or `wp`.
    # - `<ref_name>` is a reference which was used to register the object.
    #
    # For instance:
    # - Turns `##sprint:sprint_backlog` into
    #   `/projects/demo-project/sprints/23/taskboard` given there is a sprint
    #   referenced with :sprint_backlog and its ID here is 23.
    #
    #   Alternatively `##sprint.id:sprint_backlog` is translated into just the
    #   id.
    #
    # - Turns `##query:gantt_chart` into
    #   `/projects/demo-project/work_packages?query_id=1` given there is a query
    #   referenced with :gantt_chart and its ID here is 1.
    #
    #   Alternatively `##query.id:gantt_chart` is translated into just the ID.
    #
    # - Turns `##wp:some_subject` into
    #   `/projects/demo-project/work_packages/42/activity` given there is a work
    #   package referenced with :some_subject and ID here is 42.
    #
    #   Alternatively `##wp.id:some_subject` is translated into just the ID.
