  # To avoid naming conflicts, joined tables are aliased if they are joined
  # more than once. Here, joining tables that are referenced by multiple
  # columns are of particular interest.
  #
  # Mirroring the way AR creates aliases for included/joined tables: Normally,
  # included/joined associations are not aliased and as such, they simply use
  # the table name. But if an association is joined/included that relies on a
  # table which an already joined/included association also relies upon, that
  # name is already taken in the DB query. Therefore, the #alias_candidate
  # method is used which will concatenate the pluralized association name with
  # the table name the association is defined for.
  #
  # There is no handling for cases when the same association is joined/included
  # multiple times as the rest of the code should prevent that.
