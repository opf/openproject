# = OpenProject configuration file
#
# Each environment has it's own configuration options.  If you are only
# running in production, only the production block needs to be configured.
# Environment specific configuration options override the default ones.
#
# Note that this file needs to be a valid YAML file.
#
# Instead of using a configuration.yml file, you can configure OpenProject via
# environment variables. See doc/CONFIGURATION.md for more information.

  # Prefix to the url-path. This path is then prepended to all
  # the routes and is used to correclty identify the path to the assets.
  # Defaults to having no prefix.
  # Examples:
  # For OpenProject to be reachable as
  # https://example.org/open_project
  # the setting has o be:
  # rails_relative_url_root: "/open_project"
  #
  # rails_relative_url_root: ""

  # whether to force ssl in production
  # rails_force_ssl: true

  # Absolute path to the directory where attachments are stored.
  # The default is the 'files' directory in your OpenProject instance.
  # Your OpenProject instance needs to have write permission on this
  # directory.
  # Examples:
  # attachments_storage_path: /var/openproject/files
  # attachments_storage_path:

  # Configuration of the autologin cookie.
  # autologin_cookie_name: the name of the cookie (default: autologin)
  # autologin_cookie_path: the cookie path (default: /)
  # autologin_cookie_secure: true sets the cookie secure flag (default: false)
  # autologin_cookie_name:
  # autologin_cookie_path:
  # autologin_cookie_secure:

  # disable browser cache for security reasons
  # see: https://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Checks#http-cache-control-header-no-store
  # disable_browser_cache: true

  # use memcache for performance, memcached must be installed
  # rails_cache_store: :memcache

  # defines where session data is stored
  # possible values are :cookie_store, :cache_store, :active_record_store
  session_store: :cache_store

  # Configuration of SCM executable command.
  # Absolute path (e.g. /usr/local/bin/hg) or command name (e.g. hg.exe, bzr.exe)
  # On Windows, *.cmd, *.bat (e.g. hg.cmd, bzr.bat) does not work.
  # Examples:
  # scm_subversion_command: svn                                       # (default: svn)

  # Key used to encrypt sensitive data in the database (SCM and LDAP passwords).
  # If you don't want to enable data encryption, just leave it blank.
  # WARNING: losing/changing this key will make encrypted data unreadable.
  #
  # If you want to encrypt existing passwords in your database:
  # * set the cipher key here in your configuration file
  # * encrypt data using 'rake db:encrypt RAILS_ENV=production'
  #
  # If you have encrypted data and want to change this key, you have to:
  # * decrypt data using 'rake db:decrypt RAILS_ENV=production' first
  # * change the cipher key here in your configuration file
  # * encrypt data using 'rake db:encrypt RAILS_ENV=production'

  # Omniauth direct login:
  #
  # Per default the user may choose the usual password login as well as several omniauth providers
  # on the login page and in the login drop down menu.
  #
  # With his configuration option you can set a specific omniauth provider to be
  # used for direct login. Meaning that the login provider selection is skipped and
  # the configured provider is used directly instead.
  #
  # If this option is active /login will lead directly to the configured omniauth provider
  # and so will a click on 'Sign in' (as opposed to opening the drop down menu).
  #
  # Note that this does not stop a user from manually navigating to any other
  # omniauth provider if additional ones are configured.
