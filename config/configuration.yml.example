# = OpenProject configuration file
#
# Each environment has it's own configuration options.  If you are only
# running in production, only the production block needs to be configured.
# Environment specific configuration options override the default ones.
#
# Note that this file needs to be a valid YAML file.
#
# Instead of using a configuration.yml file, you can configure OpenProject via
# environment variables. See doc/CONFIGURATION.md for more information.
