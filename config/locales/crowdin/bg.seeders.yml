                      * The team plans autonomously (without the Product Owner) in detail and breaks down the tasks from the discussed requirements to consolidate a [Sprint Backlog]({{opSetting:base_url}}/projects/your-scrum-project/backlogs).

            * Divided into two additional time boxes of 4 h:

                * The Product Owner presents the [Product Backlog]({{opSetting:base_url}}/projects/your-scrum-project/backlogs) and the priorities to the team and explains the Sprint Goal, to which the team must agree. Together, they prioritize the topics from the Product Backlog which the team will take care of in the next sprint. The team commits to the discussed delivery.
                * The team plans autonomously (without the Product Owner) in detail and breaks down the tasks from the discussed requirements to consolidate a [Sprint Backlog]({{opSetting:base_url}}/projects/your-scrum-project/backlogs).
