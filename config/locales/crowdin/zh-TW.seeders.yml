Together, they prioritize the topics from the Product Backlog which the team will take care of in the next sprint. The team commits to the discussed delivery.
                      * The team plans autonomously (without the Product Owner) in detail and breaks down the tasks from the discussed requirements to consolidate a [Sprint Backlog]({{opSetting:base_url}}/projects/your-scrum-project/backlogs).

                      * What has blocked my work (Impediments)?
                  * Scrum Master moderates and notes down [Sprint Impediments](##sprint:scrum_project__version__sprint_1).
                  * Product Owner may participate may participate in order to stay informed.

                  * Important: no dummies and no PowerPoint! Just finished product functionality (Increments) should be demonstrated.
                  * Feedback from Product Owner, stakeholders and others is desired and will be included in further work.
                  * Based on the demonstrated functionalities, the Product Owner decides to go live with this increment or to develop it further. This possibility allows an early ROI.
