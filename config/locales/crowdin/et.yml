    technical_warning_html: |
      This LDAP form requires technical knowledge of your LDAP / Active Directory setup.
      <br/>
      <a href="https://www.openproject.org/help/administration/manage-ldap-authentication/">Please visit our documentation for detailed instructions</a>.
    attribute_texts:
      name: Arbitrary name of the LDAP connection
      host: LDAP host name or IP address
      login_map: The attribute key in LDAP that is used to identify the unique user login. Usually, this will be `uid` or `samAccountName`.
      generic_map: The attribute key in LDAP that is mapped to the OpenProject `%{attribute}` attribute
      admin_map_html: "Optional: The attribute key in LDAP that <strong>if present</strong> marks the OpenProject user an admin. Leave empty when in doubt."
      system_user_dn_html: |
        Enter the DN of the system user used for read-only access.
        <br/>
        Example: uid=openproject,ou=system,dc=example,dc=com
      system_user_password: Enter the bind password of the system user
      base_dn: |
        Enter the Base DN of the subtree in LDAP you want OpenProject to look for users and groups.
        OpenProject will filter for provided usernames in this subtree only.
        Example: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
      filter_string: |
        Add an optional RFC4515 filter to apply to the results returned for users filtered in the LDAP.
        This can be used to restrict the set of users that are found by OpenProject for authentication and group synchronization.
      filter_string_concat: |
        OpenProject will always filter for the login attribute provided by the user to identify the record. If you provide a filter here,
        it will be concatenated with an AND. By default, a catch-all (objectClass=*) will be used as a filter.
      onthefly_register: |
        If you check this box, OpenProject will automatically create new users from their LDAP entries
        when they first authenticate with OpenProject.
        Leave this unchecked to only allow existing accounts in OpenProject to authenticate through LDAP!
    connection_encryption: "Connection encryption"
    encryption_details: "LDAPS / STARTTLS options"

    system_account_legend: |
      OpenProject requires read-only access through a system account to lookup users and groups in your LDAP tree.
      Please specify the bind credentials for that system user in the following section.
    ldap_details: "LDAP details"
    user_settings: "Attribute mapping"
    user_settings_legend: |
      The following fields are related to how users are created in OpenProject from LDAP entries and

        Placeholder users are a way to assign work packages to users who are not part of your project. They can be useful in a range of scenarios; for example, if you need to track tasks for a resource that is not yet named or available, or if you don’t want to give that person access to OpenProject but still want to track tasks assigned to them.

      refresh_token_updated_failed: "Error during update of OAuthClientToken"
      oauth_client_not_found_explanation: >
        This error appears after you have updated the client_id and client_secret in OpenProject, but haven't updated the 'Return URI' field in the OAuth2 provider.
      oauth_code_not_present: "OAuth2 'code' not found in 'callback' endpoint (redirect_uri)."
      oauth_code_not_present_explanation: >
        This error appears if you have selected the wrong response_type in the OAuth2 provider. Response_type should be 'code' or similar.

      oauth_state_not_present_explanation: >
        The 'state' is used to indicate to OpenProject where to continue after a successful OAuth2 authorization. A missing 'state' is an internal error that may appear during setup. Please contact your system administrator.
