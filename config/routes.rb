  # Add your own custom routes here.

  # Here's a sample route:
  # map.connect 'products/:id', :controller => 'catalog', :action => 'view'
  # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

  # You can have the root of your site routed by hooking up '' 
  # -- just remember to delete public/index.html.
  map.connect '', :controller => "welcome"

  map.connect 'wiki/:id/:page/:action', :controller => 'wiki', :page => nil
  map.connect 'roles/workflow/:id/:role_id/:tracker_id', :controller => 'roles', :action => 'workflow'
  map.connect 'help/:ctrl/:page', :controller => 'help'
  #map.connect ':controller/:action/:id/:sort_key/:sort_order'
  
  # Allow downloading Web Service WSDL as a file with an extension
  # instead of a file named 'wsdl'
  map.connect ':controller/service.wsdl', :action => 'wsdl'

 
  # Install the default route as the lowest priority.
  map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
