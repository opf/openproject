Installing gems for testing
===========================

Run `rake gems RAILS_ENV=test` to list the required gems.  Run 
`rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test` to install any missing gems.

Running Tests
=============

Run `rake --tasks test` to see available tests.
`rake test` will run the entire testsuite.


Creating test repositories
===================

Redmine supports a wide array of different version control systems.
To test the support, a test repository needs to be created for each of those.

Run `rake --tasks test:scm:setup` for a list of available test-repositories or
run `rake test:scm:setup:all` to set up all of them
