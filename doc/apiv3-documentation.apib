# OpenProject API v3

# Group General

This is the current **DRAFT** of the specification for OpenProject APIv3.

Please note that everything in this document might be **subject to change** in a future version of OpenProject. We intend to keep this specification
as accurate as possible, however as long as the APIv3 is not in a stable state it is possible that there are intermediary differences between
this specification and the real implementation. While we try to only specify what we want to keep, it might also happen that parts of this
specification will be replaced **incompatibly** until the APIv3 is considered *stable*.

# HAL+JSON

HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API.
Read more: http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html

**OpenProject API implementation of HAL+JSON format** enriches JSON and introduces a few meta properties:

    - `_type` - specifies the type of the resource (e.g.: WorkPackage, Project)
    - `_links` - contains all links available for the resource
    - `_embedded` - contains all embedded objects

HAL does not guarantee that embedded resources are embedded in their full representation, they might as well be
partially represented (e.g. some properties can be left out).
However in this API you have the guarantee that whenever a resource is **embedded**, it is embedded in its **full representation**.

# API response structure

All API responses contain a single HAL+JSON object, even collections of objects are technically represented by
a single HAL+JSON object that itself contains its members. More details on collections can be found
in the [Collections Section](#collections).

# Authentication

For now the API only supports two authentication schemes: session based authentication and basic auth.
Depending on the settings of the OpenProject instance many resources can be accessed without being authenticated.
In case the instance requires authentication on all requests the client will receive an **HTTP 401** status code
in response to any request.
Otherwise unauthenticated clients have all the permissions of the anonymous user.

## Session-based Authentication

This means you have to login to OpenProject via the Web-Interface to be authenticated in the API.
This method is well-suited for clients acting within the browser, like the Angular-Client built into OpenProject.

## API Key through Basic Auth

Users can authenticate towards the API v3 using basic auth with 'apikey' as the user name and their API key as the password. Users can find their API key on their account page.

Example:

```bash
API_KEY=2519132cdf62dcf5a66fd96394672079f9e9cad1
curl -u apikey:$API_KEY https://community.openproject.com/api/v3/users/42
```

### Why not username and password?

The simplest way to do basic auth would be to use a user's username and password naturally.
However, OpenProject already has supported API keys in the past for the API v2, though not through basic auth.

Using **username and password** directly would have some advantages:

* It is intuitive for the user who then just has to provide those just as they would when logging into OpenProject.
* No extra logic for token managment necessary.

On the other hand using **API keys** has some advantages too, which is why we went for that:

* If compromised while saved on an insecure client the user only has to regenerate the API key instead of changing their password, too.
* They are naturally long and random which makes them invulnerable to dictionary attacks and harder to crack in general.

Most importantly users may not actually have a password to begin with. Specifically when they have registered
through an OpenID Connect provider.

## Future Work

For the future we plan to add authentication modes based on OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

# Allowed HTTP methods

- `GET` - Get a single resource or collection of resources
- `POST` - Create a new resource or perform
- `PATCH` - Update a resource
- `DELETE` - Delete a resource

# Compression

Responses are compressed if requested by the client. Currently [gzip](http://www.gzip.org/) and [deflate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951)
are supported. The client signals the desired compression by setting the [`Accept-Encoding` header](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.3).
If no `Accept-Encoding` header is send, `Accept-Encoding: identity` is assumed which will result in the API responding uncompressed.

# Group Basic Objects

# Links

Links to other resources in the API are represented uniformly by so called link objects.

## Local Properties

| Property  | Description                                                              | Type    | Required | Nullable | Default     |
|:---------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |:--------:|:--------:| ----------- |
| href      | URL to the referenced resource (might be relative)                       | String  |    ✓     |    ✓     |             |
| title     | Representative label for the resource                                    | String  |          |          |             |
| templated | If true the `href` contains parts that need to be replaced by the client | Boolean |          |          | false       |
| method    | The HTTP verb to use when requesting the resource                        | String  |          |          | GET         |
| payload   | The payload to send in the request to achieve the desired result         | String  |          |          | unspecified |

All link objects *must* contain the `href` property, though it might be `null`. Thus the following is a valid
link object:

    {
        "href": null
    }

whereas `{ }` is not a valid link object. The meaning of `"href": null` is that **no** resource is referenced.
For example a work package without an assignee will still have an assignee link, but its `href` will be `null`.

If a `title` is present, the client can display the title to the user when referring to the resource.

Templated links are links that contain client replaceable parts. Replaceable parts are enclosed in braces. For example
the link `api/v3/example/{id}` is not complete in itself, but the client needs to replace the string `{id}` itself.
As of now the API does not indicate the valid replacement values.

The `method` indicates which HTTP verb the client *must* use when following the link for the intended purpose.

If a `payload` is specified, it needs to be sent as the body of the request to achieve the desired result (e.g. perform the
action represented by the link). If no `payload` is specified, there is either no payload to send or a valid payload is not specified
by the link object. A payload might also be templated slightly. If the `templated` property is true, a payload might contain replaceable parts
in its strings (e.g. `{ "href": "/api/v3/examples/{example_id}" }`).

Note: When writing links (e.g. during a `PATCH` operation) only changes to `href` are accepted.
Changes to all other properties will be **silently ignored**.

# Errors

In case of an error, the API will respond with an apropriate HTTP status code.
For responses with an HTTP status of `4xx` and `5xx` the body will always contain a single error object.
Error objects shall give the client additional details about the cause of an errorneous response.

## General errors

* Error objects have their `_type` set to `Error`
* The `errorIdentifier` serves as a unique (and machine readable) identifier for a specific error cause
    * There *may* be multiple possible error identifiers per HTTP status code
    * There *may* be multiple possible HTTP status codes per error identifier
    * The "List of Error Identifiers" defines the possible mappings between HTTP status and error identifier
* The `message` contains a human readable concise message describing the error
    * It *optionally* includes specific information, for example which permission would have been needed to perform an action
    * It is localized depending on the users preferences
    * It *must not* include HTML or other kind of markup
    * Error messages form complete sentences including punctuation

### Example

    {
        "_type": "Error",
        "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InternalServerError",
        "message": "An internal server error occured. This is not your fault."
    }

## Embedded error information

Errors might optionally contain embedded objects that contain further information.

### Error details

Under the embedded key `details` there might be an object describing the error more verbosely. For example if the
error affects a specific field, this field could be defined there.

#### Example

    {
        "_type": "Error",
        "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:examples:ExampleError",
        "message": "This is an example error.",
        "_embedded": {
            "details": {
                "_type": "ExampleErrorDetailInformation",
                "errorneousField": "subject"
            }
        }
    }

### Multiple error objects

To ease implementation of basic clients it is guaranteed that the response body always only contains a single error object.
However it is allowed that an error object *embeds* other error objects under the key `errors`, thereby aggregating them.

The `errorIdentifier` of such an object is always `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MultipleErrors`. The message can either describe one of the
embedded errors or simply state that multiple errors occured.

#### Example

    {
        "_type": "Error",
        "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MultipleErrors",
        "message": "Multiple fields violated their constraints.",
        "_embedded": {
            "errors": [
                {
                    "_type": "Error",
                    "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation",
                    "...": "..."
                },
                {
                    "_type": "Error",
                    "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation",
                    "...": "..."
                }
            ]
        }
    }

## List of Error Identifiers

* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidQuery` (**HTTP 400**) - The query contained a value that did not match the servers expectation
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRequestBody` (**HTTP 400**) - The format of the request body did not match the servers expectation
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRenderContext` (**HTTP 400**) - The client specified a rendering context that does not exist

* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation` (**HTTP 422**) - The client tried to set a property to an invalid value
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyValueNotAvailableAnymore` (**HTTP 422**) - An unchanged property needs to be changed, because other changes to the resource make it unavailable
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:ResourceTypeMismatch` (**HTTP 422**) - A link to a resource of a specific type was expected, but the link to another type of resource was provided
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyFormatError` (**HTTP 422**) - A property value was provided in a format that the server does not understand or accept
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InternalServerError` (**HTTP 500**) - Default for HTTP 500 when no further information is available
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MultipleErrors` - Multiple errors occured. See the embedded `errors` array for more details.

# Formattable Text

OpenProject supports text formatting in Textile. Other text formats *may* be introduced in the future.
Properties that contain formattable text have a special representation in this API. In this specification their
type is indicated as `Formattable`. Their representation contains the following properties:

| Property | Description                                        | Type   | Example                            | Supported operations |
|:--------:| -------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| format   | Indicates the formatting language of the raw text  | String | textile                            | READ                 |
| raw      | The raw text, as entered by the user               | String | `I *am* formatted!`                | READ / WRITE         |
| html     | The text converted to HTML according to the format | String | `I <strong>am</strong> formatted!` | READ                 |

`format` can as of today have one of the following values:

* `plain` - only basic formatting, e.g. inserting paragraphs and line breaks into HTML
* `textile` - formatting using Textile
* `custom` - There is no apparent formatting rule that transforms the raw version to HTML (only used for read only properties)

More formats might be added in the future.

Note that `raw` is the only property supporting the **write** operation. A property of type *Formattable* that
is marked as **read and write**, will only accept changes to the `raw` property. Changes to `format` and `html` will be **silently ignored**.
It is thus sufficient to solely provide the `raw` property for changes.

If the *Formattable* is marked as **read only**, the `raw` attribute also becomes **read only**.

#### Example

    {
        "format": "textile",
        "raw": "I *am* formatted!",
        "html": "I <strong>am</strong> formatted!"
    }

# Dates, Times and Durations

Representation of time related values in this API is done according to [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
In this specification the following terms will be used as type specifiers (e.g. in tables):

* `Date` - refers to an ISO 8601 date, e.g. "2014-05-21"
* `DateTime` - refers to an ISO 8601 combined date and time, e.g. "2014-05-21T13:37:00Z"
* `Duration` - refers to an ISO 8601 duration, e.g. "P1DT18H"

# Colors

Colors are represented in RGB using hexadecimal notation as specified in [CSS Color Module Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/).
That is a `#` followed by either three or six hexadecimal digits.

#### Examples

    red:   #ff0000 or #f00
    green: #00ff00 or #0f0
    black: #000000 or #000
    white: #ffffff or #fff

# Digests

Digests (or Hashes) are one way functions that map data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size.
In OpenProject they are for example used to calculate checksums for (attachment) files.
The checksum calculated depends on the hashed data and the algorithm used as hash function.

Therefore all digests are represented in the following form:

| Property  | Description                                        | Type   | Example                            |
|:---------:| -------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| algorithm | The algorithm used to compute the digest           | String | md5                                |
| hash      | The calculated digest in hexadecimal notation      | String | 64c26a8403cd796ea4cf913cda2ee4a9   |

#### Example

    {
        "algorithm": "md5",
        "hash": "64c26a8403cd796ea4cf913cda2ee4a9"
    }

# Group Collections

Whenever a client calls a resource that can return more than one element, it will receive a collection of elements.
However as collections can become quite large, the API will **not** simply return a JSON array, but a special collection
object that will contain the actual elements in its embedded property `elements`.

Collections *may* be paginated, this means that a single response from the server will not contain all elements of the collection,
but only a subset. In this case the client can issue further requests to retrieve the remaining elements.
There are two ways to access the result pages of a paginated collection:

* offset based pagination
* cursor based pagination

The available ways of pagination depend on the collection queried. Some collections feature no pagination at all, meaning they
will always return all elements. Others might only offer one of the two pagination methods or both of them.
An explanation of [offset](#collections-offset-based-pagination) and [cursor](#collections-cursor-based-pagination) based
pagination can be found below the links table.

A collection also carries meta information like the total count of elements in the collection or - in case of a paginated collection -
the amount of elements returned in this response and action links to retrieve the remaining elements.

## Local Properties

| Property | Description                                                     | Type    | Availability                |
|:--------:| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| total    | The total amount of elements available in the collection        | Integer | always                      |
| pageSize | Amount of elements that a response will hold                    | Integer | when paginated              |
| count    | Actual amount of elements in this response                      | Integer | always                      |
| offset   | The page number that is requested from paginated collection     | Integer | when offset based available |
| groups   | Summarized information about aggregation groups                 | Object  | when grouping               |
| totalSums| Aggregations of supported values for elements of the collection | Object  | when showing sums           |

## Links

| Link             | Description                                                              | Availability                |
|:----------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| self             | Link to the current page in the collection                               | always                      |
| changeSize       | Templated link to change the page size, might change relative position   | when paginated              |
| jumpTo           | Templated link to jump to a specified offset                             | when offset based available |
| nextByOffset     | Link to retrieve the following page of elements (offset based)           | when offset based available |
| previousByOffset | Link to retrieve the preceding page of elements (offset based)           | when offset based available |
| nextByCursor     | Link to retrieve the elements following the current page (cursor based)  | when cursor based available |
| previousByCursor | Link to retrieve the elements preceding the current page (cursor based)  | when cursor based available |

## Offset based pagination [/api/v3/examples{?offset,pageSize}]

Offset based pagination works by specifying two values: the **offset** and the **pageSize**. The page size determines how many items there will
be in a single response at most. The offset determines which page is returned as response, with 1 being the first page (one-indexed).
Note that the server might not allow arbitrarily large page sizes, a client should therefore always check the page size accepted by the server
using the **pageSize** property of the response.

The benefit of offset based pagination is that the total number of pages can be easily determined and that it is possible to jump
to arbitrary pages within the collection. Offset based pagination is therefore well suited when a result is displayed to the end user
in the form of multiple pages anyway.

A drawback of offset based pagination comes with concurrent modification of the collection. If the collection is modified
between two page requests, it is possible that the client receives elements close to the page boundaries twice or does not see them at all.

## view offset based [GET]

+ Parameters
    + offset = `1` (optional, integer, `25`) ... Page number inside the requested collection.

    + pageSize (optional, integer, `25`) ... Number of elements to display per page.

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    + Body

            {
                "_links": {
                    "self": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?offset=25&pageSize=25" },
                    "jumpTo": {
                        "href": "/api/v3/examples?offset={offset}&pageSize=25",
                        "templated": true
                    },
                    "changeSize": {
                        "href": "/api/v3/examples?offset=25&pageSize={size}",
                        "templated": true
                    },
                    "previousByOffset": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?offset=0&pageSize=25" },
                    "previousByCursor": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?before=bar&pageSize=25" }
                },
                "_type": "Collection",
                "total": 27,
                "pageSize": 25,
                "count": 2,
                "offset": 25,
                "_embedded": {
                    "elements": [
                        { "foo": "bar" },
                        { "foo": "baz" }
                    ]
                }
            }

## Cursor based pagination [/api/v3/examples{?before,after,pageSize}]

Cursor based pagination is intended to be used, when the client needs a consistent and complete (sub-) range of the collection,
e.g. in infinite scrolling scenarios. In cursor based pagination the client will receive a link to the next and
the previous page in the result set. The guarantee is, that the boundaries of that page will align with the boundaries of the current page,
regardless of changes to the collection.

The drawback for cursor based pagination is, that it is not immediately determinable how many "next" and how many "previous" pages there are.
Cursor based pagination is therefore less suited for use cases where you want to directly "jump" to an arbitrary page.

## view cursor based [GET]

+ Parameters
    + before (optional, string, `bar`) ... Display the elements preceding the given element.
    Note that the value of this parameter is very specific to the collection, a client should not
    try to infer values, but use the **previous** link offered by the collection.

    + after (optional, string, `buz`) ... Display the elements succeeding the given element.
    Note that the value of this parameter is very specific to the collection, a client should not
    try to infer values, but use the **next** link offered by the collection.

    + pageSize (optional, integer, `25`) ... Number of elements to display per page.

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    + Body

            {
                "_links": {
                    "self": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?after=buz&pageSize=25" },
                    "changeSize": {
                        "href": "/api/v3/examples?after=buz&pageSize={size}",
                        "templated": true
                    },
                    "previousByCursor": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?before=bar&pageSize=25" }
                },
                "_type": "Collection",
                "total": 27,
                "pageSize": 25,
                "count": 2,
                "_embedded": {
                    "elements": [
                        { "foo": "bar" },
                        { "foo": "baz" }
                    ]
                }

## Aggregations [/api/v3/examples{?groupBy,showSums}]

Collections may support different kinds of aggregations.
Some properties can be summed up. If requested the collection will include the `totalSums` property,
which is a dictionary, where the keys represent the names of the summed properties and the values represent their sums.
Note that you have to mark a column as summable in the instance settings, to be able to retrieve its sums.

It is also possible to group the contents of a collection. In this case:

* the `elements` will be ordered by the specified group key (so that the client receives one group after another)
* The `groups` property will contain a collection of group objects

A group object contains aggregation data for the elements of a group:

### Local Properties

| Property | Description                                                         | Type       | Availability                |
|:--------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| value    | The value to which the group belongs (e.g. the Status' name)        | String     | always                      |
| count    | Actual amount of elements in this response                          | Integer    | always                      |
| sums     | A dictionary with property sums inside this group (see `totalSums`) | Dictionary | when sums requested         |

## Links

| Link             | Description                                                 | Availability                          |
|:----------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------- |
| valueLink        | Link to the corresponding grouping object (e.g. the Status) | only if grouping by a linkable object |

Note that you will always receive a `value`, but only receive a `valueLink` if the grouping was performed
on a linkable property.

## view aggregated result [GET]

+ Parameters
    + groupBy (optional, string, `status`) ... The column to group by.
    Note: Aggregation is as of now only supported by the work package collection.
    You can pass any column name as returned by the [queries](#queries) endpoint.

    + showSums = `false` (optional), boolean, `true` ... Indicates whether properties should be summed up if they support it.

The root resource contains links to available resources in the API. By following these links
a client should be able to discover further resources in the API.

*Note: Currently there is no list action for projects available.*
*A client will therefore have to know links to projects and can't (yet) discover them.*

## List attachments [GET]

+ Parameters
    + id (required, integer, `1`) ... ID of the work package whose attachments will be listed

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    [Attachments by work package][]

+ Response 404 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the work package does not exist or the client does not have sufficient permissions
    to see it.

    **Required permission:** view work package

    *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of a work package.
    That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:NotFound",
                "message": "The specified work package does not exist."
            }

## Add attachment [POST]

To add an attachment to a work package, a client needs to issue a request of type `multipart/form-data`
with exactly two parts.

The first part *must* be called `metadata`. Its content type is expected to be `application/json`,
the body *must* be a single JSON object, containing at least the `fileName` and optionally the attachments `description`.

The second part *must* be called `file`, its content type *should* match the mime type of the file.
The body *must* be the raw content of the file.
Note that a `filename` must be indicated in the `Content-Disposition` of this part, however it will be ignored.
Instead the `fileName` inside the JSON of the metadata part will be used.

+ Parameters
    + id (required, integer, `1`) ... ID of the work package to receive the attachment

+ Request (multipart/form-data)

        --boundary-delimiter
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="metadata"
        Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

        {
          "fileName": "cute-cat.png",
          "description": {
            "raw": "A cute kitty, cuddling with its friends!"
          }
        }

        --boundary-delimiter
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="attachment"
        Content-Type: image/png

        PNG file data
        --boundary-delimiter--

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    [Attachment][]

+ Response 400 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the client sends a not understandable request. Reasons include:

    * Omitting one of the required parts (metadata and file)
    * sending unparsable JSON in the metadata part

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRequestBody",
                "message": "The request could not be parsed as JSON."
            }

+ Response 403 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the client does not have sufficient permissions.

    **Required permission:** edit work package or add work package

    *Note that you will only receive this error, if you are at least allowed to see the work package.*

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MissingPermission",
                "message": "You are not allowed to delete this attachment."
            }

+ Response 404 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the work package does not exist or the client does not have sufficient permissions
    to see it.

    **Required permission:** view work package

    *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of a work package.
    That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:NotFound",

            }

+ Response 422 (application/hal+json)

# Group Configuration

The configuration endpoint allows to read certain configuration parameters of the OpenProject instance.
Note that there is no 1:1 relationship between this endpoint and the settings you can find in your settings.yml.

For now this endpoint will only allow access to settings deemed useful for a client to know in general.

# Group Forms

This API provides forms as a concept to aid in editing or creating resources. The goal of forms is to:

* make writable properties of a resource discoverable
* show to which values a property can be set
* validate changes to a resource and indicate validation errors

These benefits aside, a client can freely choose to immediately edit a resource without prior validation by a form.
In the case of an invalid request the edit will fail and return appropriate errors nevertheless.

A form is associated to a single resource and aids in performing changes on that resource.
When posting to a form endpoint with an empty request body or an empty JSON object,
you will receive an initial form for the associated resource.
Subsequent calls to the form should contain a single JSON object as described by the form.

## Actions

| Link                | Description                                                           | Condition                        |
|:-------------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| validate            | Validate changes, show errors and allowed values for changed resource |                                  |
| commit              | Actually perform changes to the resource                              | form content is valid            |
| previewMarkup       | Post markup (e.g. textile) here to receive an HTML-rendered response  |                                  |

## Linked Properties

| Link                | Description                                      | Type          | Nullable | Supported operations |
|:-------------------:| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| self                | This form                                        | Form          |          | READ                 |

## Embedded Properties:

Apart from the linked properties, forms contain always three other embedded properties:

* `payload`
* `schema`
* `validationErrors`

Their purpose is explained below.

### Payload

The payload contains an edited version of the resource that will be modified when commiting the form.
This representation contains all writable properties of the resource and reflects all changes that the latest call to **validate** included,
thereby acting as a preview for the changes.

In case the client tries to set the value to something invalid, the invalid change is also reflected here. However a validation error (see below)
indicates that a commit of this payload would fail.

It might happen that setting one property affects the allowed values for another property. Thus by changing a property A
the current value of another property B might become invalid. If the client did not yet touch the value of B, the payload will
contain a default value for that property. Nevertheless the client will also receive an apropriate validation error for value B.

The content of this element *can* be used as a template for the request body of a call to **validate** or **commit**.

A call to **validate** and **commit** does not need to include all properties that were defined in the `payload` section.
It is only necessary to include the properties that you want to change, as well as the `lockVersion` if one is present.
However you *may* include all the properties sent in the `payload` section.

### Schema

The schema embedded in a form is a normal [schema describing the underlying resource](#schema).
However, the embedded schema can change with each revalidation of the form.
For example it might be possible, that changing the type of a work package affects its available properties,
as well as possible values for certain properties.
As this makes the embedded schema very dynamic, it is not included as a static link.

### Validation Errors

Like a [schema](#schema) the validation errors build a dictionary where the key is a property name.
Each value is an error object that indicates the error that occured validating the corresponding property.
There are only key value pairs for properties that failed validation, the element is empty if all validations succeeded.

However note that even in the case of validation errors, the response you receive from the form endpoint will be an HTTP 200.
That is because the main purpose of a form is helping the client to sort out validation errors.

## show or validate form [POST]

This is an example of how a form might look like. Note that this endpoint does not exist in the actual implementation.

+ Request (application/json)

        {
            "lockVersion": 5,
            "_type": "Example",
            "subject": "An example title"
        }

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    [Example Form][]

+ Response 400 (application/hal+json)

    Occurs when the client did not send a valid JSON object in the request body and the request body
    was not empty.

    Note that this error only occurs when the content is not at all a single JSON object.
    It **does not occur** for requests containing undefined properties or invalid property values.

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRequestBody",
                "message": "The request body was neither empty, nor did it contain a single JSON object."
            }

+ Response 403 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the client does not have sufficient permissions to modify the associated resource.

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MissingPermission",
                "message": "You are not allowed to edit example resources."
            }

+ Response 409 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if underlying resource was changed since the client requested the form. This is determined using the `lockVersion` property.

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:UpdateConflict",
                "message": "The resource you are about to edit was changed in the meantime."
            }

# Group Previewing

Throughout OpenProject user input for many properties can be formatted (e.g. using *Textile*).
Using the appropriate rendering endpoint it is possible to render custom formatted inputs into HTML and thus
receive a preview of the rendered text.

The request to a rendering endpoint must always have a MIME-Type of `text/plain`.
The request body is the actual string that shall be rendered as HTML string.

## Textile [/api/v3/render/textile{?context}]

+ Model
    + Body

            <p>Hello world! <a href="http://example.com">This</a> <strong>is</strong> textile!</p>

## Preview Textile document [POST]

+ Parameters
    + context (optional, string, `/api/v3/work_packages/42`)
        API-Link to the context in which the rendering occurs, for example a specific work package.

        If left out only context-agnostic rendering takes place.
        Please note that OpenProject features textile-extensions that can only work given a context (e.g. display attached images).

        **Supported contexts:**

        * `/api/v3/work_packages/{id}` - an existing work package

+ Request (text/plain)

            Hello world! "This":http://example.com *is* textile!

+ Response 200 (text/html)

    [Textile][]

+ Response 400 (application/json)

    Returned if the context passed by the client is not valid (e.g. unknown).

    Note that this response will also occur when the requesting user
    is not allowed to see the context resource (e.g. limited work package visibility).

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRenderContext",
                "message": "Could not render textile string in the given context."
            }

+ Response 415 (application/json)

    Returned if the Content-Type indicated in the request is not `text/plain`.

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:TypeNotSupported",
                "message": "Expected Content-Type to be 'text/plain' but got 'application/json'."
            }

## Plain Text [/api/v3/render/plain]

+ Model
    + Body

            <p>Hello world! This *is* plain text!</p>

## Preview plain document [POST]

+ Request (text/plain)

            Hello world! This *is* plain text!

+ Response 200 (text/html)

    [Plain Text][]

+ Response 415 (application/json)

    Returned if the Content-Type indicated in the request is not `text/plain`.

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:TypeNotSupported",
                "message": "Expected Content-Type to be 'text/plain' but got 'application/json'."

## Linked Properties

| Link                | Description                              | Type          | Nullable | Supported operations |
|:-------------------:| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| self                | This schema                              | Schema        |          | READ                 |

The schema provides more detailed information about the properties of a resource.
The schema is represented by a dictionary containing names of resource properties as keys
and objects describing the corresponding property as values.
These objects are called **field schema** and form the core of the schema representation,
each of them can contain its own `_links` and `_embedded` section.

# Field schema

## Linked Properties

| Property       | Description                                                    |
|:--------------:| -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| allowedValues  | List of resources that are assignable by the current user.     |

The `allowedValues` can either contain a list of canonical links or just a single link to a collection resource.
This is an optimization to allow efficient handling of both small resource lists (that can be enumerated inline) and large
resource lists (requiring one or more separate requests).

## Local Properties

| Property          | Description                                                                        | Type     | Default |
|:-----------------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| name              | Human readable name of the property as it could be displayed in a UI               | String   |         |
| type              | The data type of the properties values                                             | MetaType |         |
| minLength         | The value of the property must at least contain the specified amount of characters | Integer  | 0       |
| maxLength         | The value of the property must at most contain the specified amount of characters  | Integer  | ∞       |
| regularExpression | The value of the property must match the given regular expression (if not null)    | String   | null    |
| required          | If true this property is not nullable                                              | Boolean  | true    |
| writable          | If false it is not allowed to **change** the properties value                      | Boolean  | true    |

All of the above properties that do not have a default value *must* be present in the schema.
For properties that have a default value, the client can assume the default value, if the property is missing.

Note that regular expressions used in the API follow the rules of [Ruby Regular Expressions](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Regexp.html).

* `locked` - the user is locked and can't log in

*Note that the properties listed here only cover the built-in properties of the OpenProject Core.
Using plug-ins and custom fields a work package might contain various additional properties.
A client can consult the schema information to which the work package links. The schema will contain information about
all properties of the linking work package, including properties added by plug-ins and custom fields.*

*Custom fields are identified by a key in the form of `customFieldN`, where `N` is an integer. Depending on their type,
they can occur as properties or as linked properties. A client has to consult the schema to resolve
the human readable name of custom fields.*

*Properties that cannot be set directly on parent work packages are inferred from their children instead:*

* `startDate` is the earliest start date from its children
* `dueDate` is the latest due date from its children
* `estimatedTime` is the sum of estimated times from its children
* `percentageDone` is the weighted average of the sum of its children percentages done. The weight is given by the average of its children estimatedHours. However, if the percentage done is given by a work package's status, then only the status matters and no value is inferred.

*Start date can also not be earlier than a due date of any predecessor.*

## Edit Work Package [PATCH]

When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing the properties and links that it wants to change, in the body.
Note that it is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the **write** operation.

Additionally to the fields the client wants to change, it is mandatory to provide the value of `lockVersion` which was received
by the `GET` request this change originates from.

The value of `lockVersion` is used to implement [optimistic locking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control).

+ Parameters
    + id (required, integer, `1`) ... Work package id

    + notify = `true` (optional, boolean, `false`) ... Indicates whether change notifications (e.g. via E-Mail) should be sent.
    Note that this controls notifications for all users interested in changes to the work package (e.g. watchers, author and assignee),
    not just the current user.

+ Request (application/json)

        {
            "lockVersion": 13,
