# OpenProject API v3

# Group General

This is the current **DRAFT** of the specification for OpenProject APIv3.

Please note that everything in this document might be **subject to change** in a future version of OpenProject. We intend to keep this specification
as accurate as possible, however as long as the APIv3 is not in a stable state it is possible that there are intermediary differences between
this specification and the real implementation. While we try to only specify what we want to keep, it might also happen that parts of this
specification will be replaced **incompatibly** until the APIv3 is considered *stable*.

# HAL+JSON

HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API.
Read more: http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html

**OpenProject API implementation of HAL+JSON format** enriches JSON and introduces a few meta properties:

    - `_type` - specifies the type of the resource (e.g.: WorkPackage, Project)
    - `_links` - contains all links available for the resource
    - `_embedded` - contains all embedded objects

HAL does not guarantee that embedded resources are embedded in their full representation, they might as well be
partially represented (e.g. some properties can be left out).
However in this API you have the guarantee that whenever a resource is **embedded**, it is embedded in its **full representation**.

# API response structure

All API responses contain a single HAL+JSON object, even collections of objects are technically represented by
a single HAL+JSON object that itself contains its members. More details on collections can be found
in the [Collections Section](#collections).

# Authentication

For now the API only supports **session-based authentication**. This means you have to login to OpenProject via
the Web-Interface to be authenticated in the API. This method is well-suited for clients acting within the browser,
like the Angular-Client built into OpenProject.

However for the future we plan to add authentication modes that are more suitable for **external clients** too.

# Allowed HTTP methods

- `GET` - Get a single resource or collection of resources
- `POST` - Create a new resource or perform
- `PATCH` - Update a resource
- `DELETE` - Delete a resource

# Group Basic Objects

# Errors

In case of an error, the API will respond with an apropriate HTTP status code.
For responses with an HTTP status of `4xx` and `5xx` the body will always contain a single error object.
Error objects shall give the client additional details about the cause of an errorneous response.

## General errors

* Error objects have their `_type` set to `Error`
* The `errorIdentifier` serves as a unique (and machine readable) identifier for a specific error cause
    * There *may* be multiple possible error identifiers per HTTP status code
    * There *may* be multiple possible HTTP status codes per error identifier
    * The "List of Error Identifiers" defines the possible mappings between HTTP status and error identifier
* The `message` contains a human readable concise message describing the error
    * It *optionally* includes specific information, for example which permission would have been needed to perform an action
    * It it localized depending on the users preferences
    * It *must not* include HTML or other kind of markup
    * Error messages form complete sentences including punctuation

### Example

    {
        "_type": "Error",
        "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InternalServerError",
        "message": "An internal server error occured. This is not your fault."
    }

## Embedded error information

Errors might optionally contain embedded objects that contain further information.

### Error details

Under the embedded key `details` there might be an object describing the error more verbosely. For example if the
error affects a specific field, this field could be defined there.

#### Example

    {
        "_type": "Error",
        "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:examples:ExampleError",
        "message": "This is an example error.",
        "_embedded": {
            "details": {
                "_type": "ExampleErrorDetailInformation",
                "errorneousField": "subject"
            }
        }
    }

### Multiple error objects

To ease implementation of basic clients it is guaranteed that the response body always only contains a single error object.
However it is allowed that an error object *embeds* other error objects under the key `errors`, thereby aggregating them.

The `errorIdentifier` of such an object is always `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MultipleErrors`. The message can either describe one of the
embedded errors or simply state that multiple errors occured.

#### Example

    {
        "_type": "Error",
        "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MultipleErrors",
        "message": "Multiple fields violated their constraints.",
        "_embedded": {
            "errors": [
                {
                    "_type": "Error",
                    "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation",
                    "...": "..."
                },
                {
                    "_type": "Error",
                    "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation",
                    "...": "..."
                }
            ]
        }
    }

## List of Error Identifiers

* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRequestBody` (**HTTP 400**) - The format of the request body did not match the servers expectation
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRenderContext` (**HTTP 400**) - The client specified a rendering context that does not exist
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MissingPermission` (**HTTP 401** / **HTTP 403**) - The client does not have the needed permissions to perform the requested action
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:NotFound` (**HTTP 404**) - Default for HTTP 404 when no further information is available
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:UpdateConflict` (**HTTP 409**) - The resource changed between GET-ing it and performing an update on it
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyIsReadOnly` (**HTTP 422**) - The client tried to set or change a property that is not writable
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation` (**HTTP 422**) - The client tried to set a property to an invalid value
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyValueNotAvailableAnymore` (**HTTP 422**) - An unchanged property needs to be changed, because other changes to the resource make it unavailable
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InternalServerError` (**HTTP 500**) - Default for HTTP 500 when no further information is available
* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MultipleErrors` - Multiple errors occured. See the embedded `errors` array for more details.

# Formatable Text

OpenProject supports text formatting in Textile. Other text formats *may* be introduced in the future.
Properties that contain formatable text have a special representation in this API. In this specification their
type is indicated as `Formatable`. Their representation contains the following properties:

| Property | Description                                        | Type   | Example                            | Supported operations |
|:--------:| -------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| format   | Indicates the formatting language of the raw text  | String | textile                            | READ                 |
| raw      | The raw text, as entered by the user               | String | `I *am* formatted!`                | READ / WRITE         |
| html     | The text converted to HTML according to the format | String | `I <strong>am</strong> formatted!` | READ                 |

`format` can as of today have one of the following values:

* `plain` - no formatting at all
* `textile` - formatting using Textile

More formats might be added in the future.

Note that `raw` is the only property supporting the **write** operation. A property of type *Formatable* that
is marked as **read and write**, will only accept changes to the `raw` property. Changes to `format` and `html` will be **silently ignored**.
It is thus sufficient to solely provide the `raw` property for changes.

If the *Formatable* is marked as **read only**, the `raw` attribute also becomes **read only**.

#### Example

    {
        "format": "textile",
        "raw": "I *am* formatted!",
        "html": "I <strong>am</strong> formatted!"
    }

# Dates, Times and Durations

Representation of time related values in this API is done according to [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
In this specification the following terms will be used as type specifiers (e.g. in tables):

* `Date` - refers to an ISO 8601 date, e.g. "2014-05-21"
* `DateTime` - refers to an ISO 8601 combined date and time, e.g. "2014-05-21T13:37:00Z"
* `Duration` - refers to an ISO 8601 duration, e.g. "P1DT18H"

# Colors

Colors are represented in RGB using hexadecimal notation as specified in [CSS Color Module Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/).
That is a `#` followed by either three or six hexadecimal digits.

#### Examples

    red:   #ff0000 or #f00
    green: #00ff00 or #0f0
    black: #000000 or #000
    white: #ffffff or #fff

# Group Collections

Whenever a client calls a resource that can return more than one element, it will receive a collection of elements.
However as collections can become quite large, the API will **not** simply return a JSON array, but a special collection
object that will contain the actual elements in its embedded property `elements`.

Collections *may* be paginated, this means that a single response from the server will not contain all elements of the collection,
but only a subset. In this case the client can issue further requests to retrieve the remaining elements.
There are two ways to access the result pages of a paginated collection:

* offset based pagination
* cursor based pagination

The available ways of pagination depend on the collection queried. Some collections feature no pagination at all, meaning they
will always return all elements. Others might only offer one of the two pagination methods or both of them.
An explanation of [offset](#collections-offset-based-pagination) and [cursor](#collections-cursor-based-pagination) based
pagination can be found below the links table.

A collection also carries meta information like the total count of elements in the collection or - in case of a paginated collection -
the amount of elements returned in this response and action links to retrieve the remaining elements.

## Properties

| Property | Description                                                     | Type    | Availability                |
|:--------:| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| total    | The total amount of elements available in the collection        | Integer | always                      |
| pageSize | Amount of elements that a response will hold                    | Integer | when paginated              |
| count    | Actual amount of elements in this response                      | Integer | always                      |
| offset   | Amount of elements preceding the first element of this response | Integer | when offset based available |

## Links

| Link             | Description                                                              | Availability                |
|:----------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| self             | Link to the current page in the collection                               | always                      |
| changeSize       | Templated link to change the page size, preserving the relative position | when paginated              |
| filter           | Templated link to receive only elements matching the provided OQL query  | when filtering available    |
| jumpTo           | Templated link to jump to a specified offset                             | when offset based available |
| nextByOffset     | Link to retrieve the following page of elements (offset based)           | when offset based available |
| previousByOffset | Link to retrieve the preceding page of elements (offset based)           | when offset based available |
| nextByCursor     | Link to retrieve the elements following the current page (cursor based)  | when cursor based available |
| previousByCursor | Link to retrieve the elements preceding the current page (cursor based)  | when cursor based available |

### Filters

Filters are specified using the [OpenProject Query Language (OQL)](https://github.com/opf/oql).

The syntax of OQL queries is explained in the [OQL Documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/opf/oql/dev). All properties of the underlying resource can be used
in the query, e.g. when filtering over a collection of work packages, it is possible to compare the `subject` with any value.

Note that for linked resources you can either compare against the **ID** of the linked resource or against its **link URL**:

    # valid
    status == "1"
    status == "/api/v3/statuses/1"

    # NOT valid
    status == "New"

## Offset based pagination [/api/v3/examples{?offset,pageSize}]

Offset based pagination works by specifying two values: the **offset** and the **pageSize**. The offset determines how many elements are
skipped before the first element that is present in the result. The page size determines how many items there will be in the result. Note
that the server might not allow arbitrarily large page sizes, a client should therefore always check the page size accepted by the server
using the **pageSize** property of the response.

The benefit of offset based pagination is that the total number of pages can be easily determined and that it is possible to jump
to arbitrary pages within the collection. Offset based pagination is therefore well suited when a result is displayed to the end user
in the form of multiple pages anyway.

A drawback of offset based pagination comes with concurrent modification of the collection. If the collection is modified
between two page requests, it is possible that the client receives elements close to the page boundaries twice or does not see them at all.

## view offset based [GET]

+ Parameters
    + offset = `0` (optional, integer, `25`) ... Number of elements to skip before the first element of the response.

    + pageSize (optional, integer, `25`) ... Number of elements to display per page.

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    + Body

            {
                "_links": {
                    "self": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?offset=25&pageSize=25" },
                    "jumpTo": {
                        "href": "/api/v3/examples?offset={offset}&pageSize=25",
                        "templated": true
                    },
                    "changeSize": {
                        "href": "/api/v3/examples?offset=25&pageSize={size}",
                        "templated": true
                    },
                    "previousByOffset": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?offset=0&pageSize=25" },
                    "previousByCursor": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?before=bar&pageSize=25" }
                },
                "_type": "Collection",
                "total": 27,
                "pageSize": 25,
                "count": 2,
                "offset": 25,
                "_embedded": {
                    "elements": [
                        { "foo": "bar" },
                        { "foo": "baz" }
                    ]
                }
            }

## Cursor based pagination [/api/v3/examples{?before,after,pageSize}]

Cursor based pagination is intended to be used, when the client needs a consistent and complete (sub-) range of the collection,
e.g. in infinite scrolling scenarios. In cursor based pagination the client will receive a link to the next and
the previous page in the result set. The guarantee is, that the boundaries of that page will align with the boundaries of the current page,
regardless of changes to the collection.

The drawback for cursor based pagination is, that it is not immediately determinable how many "next" and how many "previous" pages there are.
Cursor based pagination is therefore less suited for use cases where you want to directly "jump" to an arbitrary page.

## view cursor based [GET]

+ Parameters
    + before (optional, string, `bar`) ... Display the elements preceding the given element.
    Note that the value of this parameter is very specific to the collection, a client should not
    try to infer values, but use the **previous** link offered by the collection.

    + after (optional, string, `buz`) ... Display the elements succeeding the given element.
    Note that the value of this parameter is very specific to the collection, a client should not
    try to infer values, but use the **next** link offered by the collection.

    + pageSize (optional, integer, `25`) ... Number of elements to display per page.

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    + Body

            {
                "_links": {
                    "self": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?after=buz&pageSize=25" },
                    "changeSize": {
                        "href": "/api/v3/examples?after=buz&pageSize={size}",
                        "templated": true
                    },
                    "previousByCursor": { "href": "/api/v3/examples?before=bar&pageSize=25" }
                },
                "_type": "Collection",
                "total": 27,
                "pageSize": 25,

# Group Forms

This API provides forms as a concept to aid in editing or creating resources. The goal of forms is to:

* make writable properties of a resource discoverable
* show to which values a property can be set
* validate changes to a resource and indicate validation errors

These benefits aside, a client can freely choose to immediately edit a resource without prior validation by a form.
In the case of an invalid request the edit will fail and return appropriate errors nevertheless.

A form is associated to a single resource and aids in performing changes on that resource.
When posting to a form endpoint with an empty request body or an empty JSON object,
you will receive an initial form for the associated resource.
Subsequent calls to the form should contain a single JSON object as described by the form.

## Actions:

| Link                | Description                                                           | Condition                        |
|:-------------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| validate            | Validate changes, show errors and allowed values for changed resource |                                  |
| commit              | Actually perform changes to the resource                              | form content is valid            |
| previewMarkup       | Post markup (e.g. textile) here to receive an HTML-rendered response  |                                  |

## Embedded Properties:

Forms contain exactly three embedded properties:

* `payload`
* `schema`
* `validationErrors`

Their purpose is explained below.

### Payload

The payload contains an edited version of the resource that will be modified when commiting the form.
This representation contains all writable properties of the resource and reflects all changes that the latest call to **validate** included,
thereby acting as a preview for the changes.

In case the client tries to set the value to something invalid, the invalid change is also reflected here. However a validation error (see below)
indicates that a commit of this payload would fail.

It might happen that setting one property affects the allowed values for another property. Thus by changing a property A
the current value of another property B might become invalid. If the client did not yet touch the value of B, the payload will
contain a default value for that property. Nevertheless the client will also receive an apropriate validation error for value B.

The content of this element *can* be used as a template for the request body of a call to **validate** or **commit**.

### Schema

The schema provides more detailed information about the properties of a resource.
Technically `schema` is a dictionary containing names of properties as keys
and objects describing the corresponding property as values. The values are called **field schema**.

#### Field schema

**Linked Properties**

| Property       | Description                                                    |
|:--------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| allowedValues  | List of resources that are assignable by the current user.     |

**Properties**

| Property       | Description                                                    | Default |
|:--------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------| ------- |
| types          | The possible data types of the properties values               |         |
| required       | If true every request **must** contain this property           | false   |
| writable       | If false it is not allowed to **change** the properties value  | true    |

**Remarks**

The `allowedValues` can either contain a list of canonical links or just a single link to a collection resource.
This is an optimization to allow efficient handling of both small resource lists (that can be enumerated inline) and large
resource lists (requiring one or more separate requests).

A call to **validate** and **commit** does not need to include all properties that were defined in the `payload` section.
It is only necessary to include the properties that you want to change and the properties that are defined as **required**
by the field schema. However you *may* include all the properties sent in the `payload` section.

### Validation Errors

Like `schema` the validation errors build a dictionary where the key is a property name.
Each value is an error object that indicates the error that occured validating the corresponding property.
There are only key value pairs for properties that failed validation, the element is empty if all validations succeeded.

However note that even in the case of validation errors, the response you receive from the form endpoint will be an HTTP 200.
That is because the main purpose of a form is helping the client to sort out validation errors.

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:UpdateConflict",

# Group Previewing

Throughout OpenProject user input for many properties can be formatted (e.g. using *Textile*).
Using the apropriate rendering endpoint it is possible to render custom formatted inputs into HTML and thus
receive a preview of the rendered text.

The request to a rendering endpoint should always have a MIME-Type of `text/plain`.
The request body is the actual string that shall be rendered as HTML string.

## Textile [/api/v3/render/textile{?context}]

+ Model
    + Body

            <p>Hello world! <a href="http://example.com">This</a> <strong>is</strong> textile!</p>

## Preview Textile document [POST]

+ Parameters
    + context (optional, string, `/api/v3/work_packages/42`)
        API-Link to the context in which the rendering occurs, for example a specific work package.

        If left out only context-agnostic rendering takes place.
        Please note that OpenProject features textile-extensions that can only work given a context (e.g. display attached images).

        **Supported contexts:**

        * `/api/v3/work_packages/{id}` - an existing work package

+ Request (text/plain)

            Hello world! "This":http://example.com *is* textile!

+ Response 200 (text/html)

    [Textile][]

+ Response 400 (application/json)

    Returned if the context passed by the client is not valid (e.g. unknown).

    Note that this response will also occur when the requesting user
    is not allowed to see the context resource (e.g. limited work package visibility).

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRenderContext",
                "message": "Could not render textile string in the given context."
            }

## List projects with version [GET]

This endpoint lists the projects where the given version is available.

The projects returned depend on the sharing settings of the given version,
but are also limited to the projects that the current user is allowed to see.

+ Parameters
    + id (required, integer, `1`) ... Version id

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    [Projects by version][]

+ Response 404 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the version does not exist or the client does not have sufficient permissions
    to see it.

    **Required permission:** view work packages **or** manage versions (any project where the given version is available)

    *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of a version.
    That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*

## List versions available in a project [GET]

This endpoint lists the versions that are *available* in a given project.
Note that due to sharing this might be more than the versions *defined* by that project.

+ Parameters
    + project_id (required, integer, `1`) ... ID of the project whoose versions will be listed

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    [Versions by Project][]

+ Response 404 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the project does not exist or the client does not have sufficient permissions
    to see it.

    **Required permission:** view work packages **or** manage versions (on given project)

    *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of a project.
    That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:NotFound",

## View work package [GET]

+ Parameters
    + id (required, integer, `1`) ... Work package id

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    [WorkPackage][]

## Edit WorkPackage [PATCH]

When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing the properties and links that it wants to change, in the body.
Note that it is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the **write** operation.

Additionally to the fields the client wants to change, it is mandatory to provide:

* The `_type` which should as of now always be `WorkPackage`
* The value of `lockVersion` which was received by the `GET` request this change originates from

The value of `lockVersion` is used to implement [optimistic locking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control).

+ Parameters
    + id (required, integer, `1`) ... Work package id

    + notify = `true` (optional, boolean, `false`) ... Indicates whether change notifications (e.g. via E-Mail) should be sent.
    Note that this controls notifications for all users interested in changes to the work package (e.g. watchers, author and assignee),
    not just the current user.

+ Request (application/json)

        {
            "_type": "WorkPackage",
            "lockVersion": 13,
            "subject": "Lorem"
            "parentId": "42"
        }

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    [WorkPackage][]

+ Response 400 (application/hal+json)

    Occurs when the client did not send a valid JSON object in the request body.

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRequestBody",
                "message": "The request body was not a single JSON object."
            }

+ Response 403 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the client does not have sufficient permissions.

    **Required permission:** edit work package

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MissingPermission",
                "message": "You are not allowed to edit the content of the work package."
            }

+ Response 409 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the resource was changed since the client requested it. This is determined using the `lockVersion` property.

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:UpdateConflict",
                "message": "Your changes could not be saved, because the work package was changed since you've seen it the last time."
            }

+ Response 422 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if:
    * the client tries to modify a read-only property
    * a constraint for a property was violated

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation",
                "message": "The subject might not be blank.",
