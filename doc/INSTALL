redMine - project management software
Copyright (C) 2006-2007  Jean-Philippe Lang

== Requirements

* Ruby on Rails 1.2.2
* Iconv
* A database (see compatibility below)

Optional:
* RedCloth (to enable textile formatting)
* SVN binaries (needed for repository browsing, must be available in PATH)

Supported databases:
* MySQL (tested with MySQL 5)
* PostgreSQL (tested with PostgreSQL 8.1)
* Oracle (tested with Oracle 10g)
* SQL Server (tested with SQL Server 2005)
* SQLite (tested with SQLite 3)


== Installation

1. Uncompress program archive:
   tar zxvf <filename>
   
2. Create an empty database: "redmine" for example

3. Configure database parameters in config/database.yml
   for "production" environment (default database is MySQL)

4. Create the database structure. Under the application main directory:
   rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
   It will create tables and an administrator account.

5. Insert default configuration data in database:
   rake load_default_data RAILS_ENV="production"
   It will load default roles, trackers, statuses, workflows and enumerations.
   This step is optional (but recommended), as you can define your
   own configuration from sratch.

6. Test the installation by running WEBrick web server:
   ruby script/server -e production   
  
   Once WEBrick has started, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/
   You should now see the application welcome page

7. Use default administrator account to log in:
   login: admin
   password: admin
   
8. You can go to "Admin -> Settings" to modify application settings.

9. Setup Apache or Lighttpd with fastcgi for best performance.


== SMTP server Configuration

In config/environment.rb, you can set parameters for your SMTP server:
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings: SMTP server configuration
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries: set to false to disable mail delivering

Don't forget to restart the application after any change.
