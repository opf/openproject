== Requirements

* Ruby on Rails 2.1
* A database:
  * MySQL (tested with MySQL 5)
  * PostgreSQL (tested with PostgreSQL 8.1)
  * SQLite (tested with SQLite 3)

Optional:
* SVN binaries >= 1.3 (needed for repository browsing, must be available in PATH)
* RMagick (gantt export to png)

== Installation

1. Uncompress the program archive
   
2. Create an empty database: "redmine" for example

3. Configure database parameters in config/database.yml
   for "production" environment (default database is MySQL)

4. Create the database structure. Under the application main directory:
   rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
   It will create tables and an administrator account.

5. Setting up permissions
   The user who runs Redmine must have write permission on the following
   subdirectories: files, log, tmp (create the last one if not present).

   Assuming you run Redmine with a user named redmine:
     mkdir tmp
     sudo chown -R redmine:redmine files log tmp
     sudo chmod -R 755 files log tmp

6. Test the installation by running WEBrick web server:
   ruby script/server -e production   
  
   Once WEBrick has started, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/
   You should now see the application welcome page

7. Use default administrator account to log in:
   login: admin
   password: admin
   
   Go to "Administration" to load the default configuration data (roles, 
   trackers, statuses, workflow) and adjust application settings


== Email delivery Configuration

to adjust your SMTP settings.
