  # = Tokens
  #
  # The Tokens class represents a list of tokens returnd from
  # a Scanner.
  #
  # A token is not a special object, just a two-element Array
  # consisting of
  # * the _token_ _kind_ (a Symbol representing the type of the token)
  # * the _token_ _text_ (the original source of the token in a String)
  #
  # A token looks like this:
  #
  #   [:comment, '# It looks like this']
  #   [:float, '3.1415926']
  #   [:error, 'הצ']
  #
  # Some scanners also yield some kind of sub-tokens, represented by special
  # token texts, namely :open and :close .
  #
  # The Ruby scanner, for example, splits "a string" into:
  #
  #  [
  #   [:open, :string],
  #   [:delimiter, '"'],
  #   [:content, 'a string'],
  #   [:delimiter, '"'],
  #   [:close, :string]
  #  ]
  #
  # Tokens is also the interface between Scanners and Encoders:
  # The input is split and saved into a Tokens object. The Encoder
  # then builds the output from this object.
  #
  # Thus, the syntax below becomes clear:
  #
  #   CodeRay.scan('price = 2.59', :ruby).html
  #   # the Tokens object is here -------^
  #
  # See how small it is? ;)
  #
  # Tokens gives you the power to handle pre-scanned code very easily:
  # You can convert it to a webpage, a YAML file, or dump it into a gzip'ed string
  # that you put in your DB.
  #
  # Tokens' subclass TokenStream allows streaming to save memory.
