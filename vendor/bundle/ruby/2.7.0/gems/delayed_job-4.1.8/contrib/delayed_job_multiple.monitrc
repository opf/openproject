# an example Monit configuration file for delayed_job running multiple processes
#
# To use:
# 1. copy to /var/www/apps/{app_name}/shared/delayed_job.monitrc
# 2. replace {app_name} as appropriate
#    you might also need to change the program strings to
#           "/bin/su - {username} -c '/usr/bin/env ...'"
#    to load your shell environment.
#
# 3. add this to your /etc/monit/monitrc
#
#   include /var/www/apps/{app_name}/shared/delayed_job.monitrc
#
# The processes are grouped so that monit can act on them as a whole, e.g.
#
#   monit -g delayed_job restart
