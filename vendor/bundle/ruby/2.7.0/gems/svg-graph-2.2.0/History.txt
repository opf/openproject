=== 2.1.0 / 2017-02-26 [lumean]
* [#2] change behavior for number format, Strings axis labels will never be formatted
  previously, when containing numbers they were formatted with the number_format template
* [#3] added options to change x-axis and y-axis position :x_axis_position and :y_axis_position
* x_guidelines and y_guidelines can now be drawn independently of show_x_labels and show_y_labels,
  before they were only drawn if show_x_labels resp show_y_labels was true
* fix number_format not being applied to x-axis labels
* fix popups being somtimes outside visible region of graph

=== 2.0.2 / 2016-10-24 [lumean]
* fix axis-title positioning
* fix/add support for popups of values line, plot, bar graph
* Line,Plot,Pie graph support nil values (or pairs of nil for plot) for non-present datapoints
* fix show datapoint labels: changed text anchor of first datapoint label to avoid overlap with axis
  and text anchor of last datapoint label
* fix pie graph key overlapping the graph [thanks adamalbrecht for reporting]
* fix axis titles positioning for staggered axis (prevent overlap)
* fix axis labels and positioning when scale_integers is true and min value is not integer.
* added various comments in the code to be better understandable (for me)

=== 2.0.1 / 2016-08-09
* dropped support for ruby 1.8.7 [lumean]
* Merge ErrBar graph from https://github.com/mondhs/svg-graph
* Merge number formatting to have more readable floats from https://github.com/mondhs/svg-graph
* fix warnings [lumean]
* make TimeSeries and Schedule work with ruby >2.0 and the Date/DateTime stdlib [lumean]

* all ruby files in the test directory now run on ruby >2.0 and write output to files [lumean]
* changed from autoload to static loading due to issues with unit-testing when the gem is not installed [lumean]
* begin transition to minitest for tests [lumean]
* merged fix for 100% pie graphs from https://github.com/endersstocker/svg-graph
* fix wrong margins for labels after merge of number formatting [lumean]
* Add new option for locations for the axis titles (at the end of the axis instead of below / left from it) [lumean]
* improved x-axis label location when x-axis marks are vertical and long [lumean]

=== 1.0.5 / 2011-09-03
* enabled all svg_graph tests[liehann]

=== 1.0.4 / 2011-09-03

* New shapes can be specified through lambdas that accept parameters x,y (coordinates) and the dataset number.[pgbossi]
* Max x and y values & allow Time objects in TimeSeries data. [pgbossi]
* Popup hovering area is now customizable (it defaults to radius=10). [pgbossi]
