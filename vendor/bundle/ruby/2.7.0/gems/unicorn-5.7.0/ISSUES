mailto:unicorn-public@yhbt.net is the best place to report bugs,
submit patches and/or obtain support after you have searched the
{email archives}[https://yhbt.net/unicorn-public/] and
{documentation}[https://yhbt.net/unicorn/].

* No subscription will ever be required to email us
* Cc: all participants in a thread or commit, as subscription is optional
* Do not {top post}[http://catb.org/jargon/html/T/top-post.html] in replies
* Quote as little as possible of the message you're replying to
* Do not send HTML mail or images,
  they hurt reader privacy and will be flagged as spam
* Anonymous and pseudonymous messages will ALWAYS be welcome
* The email submission port (587) is enabled on the yhbt.net MX:
  https://yhbt.net/unicorn-public/20141004232241.GA23908@dcvr.yhbt.net/t/

We will never have a centralized or formal bug tracker.  Instead we
can interoperate with any bug tracker which can Cc: us plain-text to
mailto:unicorn-public@yhbt.net   This includes the Debian BTS
at https://bugs.debian.org/unicorn and possibly others.

If your issue is of a sensitive nature or you're just shy in public,
use anonymity tools such as Tor or Mixmaster; and rely on the public
mail archives for responses.  Be sure to scrub sensitive log messages
and such.

If you don't get a response within a few days, we may have forgotten
about it so feel free to ask again.

== Bugs in related projects

unicorn is sometimes affected by bugs in its dependencies.  Bugs
triggered by unicorn in mainline Ruby, rack, GNU C library (glibc),
or the Linux kernel will be reported upstream and fixed.

For bugs in Ruby itself, we may forward bugs to
https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/ and discuss+fix them on the ruby-core
list at mailto:ruby-core@ruby-lang.org
Subscription to post is required to ruby-core, unfortunately:
mailto:ruby-core-request@ruby-lang.org?subject=subscribe
Unofficial archives are available at: https://public-inbox.org/ruby-core/

For uncommon bugs in Rack, we may forward bugs to
mailto:rack-devel@googlegroups.com and discuss there.
Subscription (without any web UI or Google account) is possible via:
mailto:rack-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com
Note: not everyone can use the proprietary bug tracker used by Rack,
but their mailing list remains operational.
Unofficial archives are available at: https://public-inbox.org/rack-devel/

Uncommon bugs we encounter in the Linux kernel should be Cc:-ed to the
Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) at mailto:linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
and subsystem maintainers such as mailto:netdev@vger.kernel.org
(for networking issues).  It is expected practice to Cc: anybody
involved with any problematic commits (including those in the
Signed-off-by: and other trailer lines).  No subscription is necessary,
and the our mailing list follows the same conventions as LKML for
interopability. Archives are available at https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/
There is a kernel.org Bugzilla instance, but it is ignored by most.

Likewise for any rare glibc bugs we might encounter, we should Cc:
mailto:libc-alpha@sourceware.org
Unofficial archives are available at: https://public-inbox.org/libc-alpha/
Keep in mind glibc upstream does use Bugzilla for tracking bugs:
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/

== Submitting Patches

See the HACKING document (and additionally, the
{SubmittingPatches}[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches]
document distributed with git) on guidelines for patch submission.
