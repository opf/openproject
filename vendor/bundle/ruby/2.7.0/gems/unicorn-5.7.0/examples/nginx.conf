# This is example contains the bare mininum to get nginx going with
# unicorn servers.  Generally these configuration settings
# are applicable to other HTTP application servers (and not just Ruby

# server, feel free to continue using it.

# The only setting we feel strongly about is the fail_timeout=0
# directive in the "upstream" block.  max_fails=0 also has the same
# effect as fail_timeout=0 for current versions of nginx and may be
# used in its place.

# Users are strongly encouraged to refer to nginx documentation for more
# details and search for other example configs.
