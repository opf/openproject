=== unicorn 5.5.0 / 2019-03-04 00:41 UTC

  Mostly identical to 5.5.0.pre1, which I didn't hear any feedback
  from:

  Otherwise, there's one extra change to use
  rb_gc_register_mark_object which is finally a documented part of
  the Ruby C-API, but has existed since the 1.9 days.

  There's also a couple of uninteresting minor optimizations and
  documentation additions.

=== unicorn 5.4.0 / 2017-12-23 23:33 UTC

  Rack hijack support improves as the app code can capture and use
  the Rack `env' privately without copying it (to avoid clobbering
  by another client).  Thanks to Sam Saffron for reporting and
  testing this new feature:
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/CAAtdryPG3nLuyo0jxfYW1YHu1Q+ZpkLkd4KdWC8vA46B5haZxw@mail.gmail.com/T/

  We also now support $DEBUG being set by the Rack app (instead of
  relying on the "-d" CLI switch).  Thanks to James P Robinson Jr
  for reporting this bug:
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/D6324CB4.7BC3E%25james.robinson3@cigna.com/T/
    (Coincidentally, this fix will be irrelevant for Ruby 2.5
     which requires 'pp' by default)

  There's a few minor test cleanups and documentation updates, too.

  All commits since v5.3.1 (2017-10-03):

      reduce method calls with String#start_with?
      require 'pp' if $DEBUG is set by Rack app

=== unicorn 5.3.0 / 2017-04-01 08:03 UTC

  A couple of portability fixes from Dylan Thacker-Smith and
  Jeremy Evans since 5.3.0.pre1 over a week ago, but this looks
  ready for a stable release, today.

  When I started this over 8 years ago, I wondered if this would
  just end up being an April Fools' joke.  Guess not.  I guess I
  somehow tricked people into using a terribly marketed web server
  that cannot talk directly to untrusted clients :x  Anyways,
  unicorn won't be able to handle slow clients 8 years from now,
  either, or 80 years from now.  And I vow never to learn to use
  new-fangled things like epoll, kqueue, or threads :P

  Anyways, this is a largish release with several new features,
  and no backwards incompatibilities.

  Simon Eskildsen contributed heavily using TCP_INFO under Linux
  to implement the (now 5 year old) check_client_connection feature:

    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-check_client_connection
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:check_client_connection&d:..20170401&x=t

  This also led to FreeBSD and OpenBSD portability improvements in
  one of our dependencies, raindrops:

     https://bogomips.org/raindrops-public/20170323024829.GA5190@dcvr/T/#u

  Jeremy Evans contributed several new features.  First he
  implemented after_worker_exit to aid debugging:

    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-after_worker_exit
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:after_worker_exit&d:..20170401&x=t#t

  And then security-related features to isolate workers.  Workers
  may now chroot to drop access to the master filesystem, and the
  new after_worker_ready configuration hook now exists to aid with
  chroot support in workers:

    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-after_worker_ready
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Worker.html#method-i-user
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:after_worker_ready&d:..20170401&x=t#t
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:chroot&d:..20170401&x=t#t

  Additionally, workers may run in a completely different VM space
  (nullifying preload_app and any CoW savings) with the new
  worker_exec option:

    https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-worker_exec
    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:worker_exec&d:..20170401&x=t#t

  There are also several improvements to FreeBSD and OpenBSD
  support with the addition of these features.

=== unicorn 5.2.0 / 2016-10-31 20:00 UTC

  Most notably, this release allows us to support requests with
  lines delimited by LF-only, as opposed to the standard CRLF
  pair and allowed by RFC 2616 sec 19.3.

  Thanks to Mishael A Sibiryakov for the explanation and change:

    https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/1476954332.1736.156.camel@junki.org/

  Thanks to Let's Encrypt, the website also moves to HTTPS
  <https://bogomips.org/unicorn/> to improve reader privacy.  The
  "unicorn.bogomips.org" subdomain will be retired soon to reduce
  subjectAltName bloat and speed up certificate renewals.

  There's also the usual round of documentation and example
  updates, too.

=== unicorn 5.1.0 - rack is optional, again / 2016-04-01 00:35 UTC

  Note: no code changes since 5.1.0.pre1 from January.^WNo, wait,
  last minute performance improvement added today.  See below.

  The big change is rack is not required (but still recommended).
  Applications are expected to depend on rack on their own so they can
  specify the version of rack they prefer without unicorn pulling
  in a newer, potentially incompatible version.

  unicorn will always attempt to work with multiple versions of rack
  as practical.

  The HTTP parser also switched to using the TypedData C-API for
  extra type safety and memory usage accounting support in the
  'objspace' extension.

  Thanks to Adam Duke to bringing the rack change to our attention
  and Aaron Patterson for helping with the matter.

  Last minute change: we now support the new leftpad() syscall under
  Linux for major performance and security improvement:

      http://mid.gmane.org/1459463613-32473-1-git-send-email-richard@nod.at

  8^H9 changes since 5.0.1:

        http: TypedData C-API conversion
        various documentation updates
        doc: bump olddoc to ~> 1.2 for extra NNTP URL
        rack is optional at runtime, required for dev
        doc update for ClientShutdown exceptions class
        unicorn 5.1.0.pre1 - rack is optional, again
        doc: reference --keep-file-descriptors for "bundle exec"
        doc: further trimming to reduce noise
        use leftpad Linux syscall for speed!

  There might be more documentation-related changes before 5.1.0
  final.  I am considering dropping pandoc from manpage generation
  and relying on pod2man (from Perl) because it has a wider install
  base.

=== unicorn 5.0.1 - continuing to violate Rack SPEC / 2015-11-17 22:44 UTC

  Once again, we allow nil values in response headers.  We've had
  this bug since March 2009, and thus cannot expect existing
  applications and middlewares running unicorn to fix this.

  Unfortunately, supporting this bug contributes to application
  server lock-in, but at least we'll document it as such.

  Thanks to Owen Ou <o@heroku.com> for reporting this regression:

    http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/CAO47=rJa=zRcLn_Xm4v2cHPr6c0UswaFC_omYFEH+baSxHOWKQ@mail.gmail.com/

  Additionally, systemd examples are now in the examples/ directory
  based on a post by Christos Trochalakis <yatiohi@ideopolis.gr>:

    http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/20150708130821.GA1361@luke.ws.skroutz.gr/

=== unicorn 5.0.0 - most boring major release. EVER. / 2015-11-01 08:48 UTC

  An evolutionary dead-end since its announcement[1] nearly six years
  ago, this old-fashioned preforker has had enough bugs and missteps
  that it's managed to hit version 5!

  I wish I could say unicorn 5 is leaps and bounds better than 4, but
  it is not.  This major version change allows us to drop some cruft
  and unused features which accumulated over the years, resulting in
  several kilobytes of memory saved[2]!

  Compatibility:

  * The horrible, proprietary (:P) "Status:" response header is
    finally gone, saving at least 16 precious bytes in every HTTP
    response.  This should make it easier to write custom HTTP clients
    which are compatible across all HTTP servers.  It will hopefully
    make migrating between different Rack servers easier for new
    projects.

  * Ruby 1.8 support removed.  Ruby 1.9.3 is currently the earliest
    supported version.  However, expect minor, likely-unnoticeable
    performance regressions if you use Ruby 2.1 or earlier.  Going
    forward, unicorn will favor the latest version (currently 2.2) of
    the mainline Ruby implementation, potentially sacrificing
    performance on older Rubies.

  * Some internal, undocumented features and APIs used by
    derivative servers are gone; removing bloat and slightly lowering
    memory use.  We have never and will never endorse the use of any
    applications or middleware with a dependency on unicorn,
    applications should be written for Rack instead.
    Note: Rainbows! 5.0 will be released next week or so to be
    compatible with unicorn 5.x

  New features:

  * sd_listen_fds(3) emulation added for systemd compatibility.
    You may now stop using PID files and other process monitoring
    software when using systemd.

  * Newly-set TCP socket options are now applied to inherited sockets.

  * Dynamic changes in the application to Rack::Utils::HTTP_STATUS
    hash is now supported; allowing users to set custom status lines
    in Rack to be reflected in unicorn.  This feature causes a minor
    performance regression, but is made up for Ruby 2.2 users with
    other optimizations.

  * The monotonic clock is used under Ruby 2.1+, making the
    timeout feature immune to system clock changes.

  As unicorn may be used anonymously without registration, the
  project is committed to supporting anonymous and pseudonymous
  help requests, contributions and feedback via plain-text mail to:

      unicorn-public@bogomips.org

  The mail submission port (587) is open to those behind firewalls
  and allows access via Tor and anonymous remailers.
  Archives are accessible via: http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/
  and mirrored to various other places, so you do not need to use
  a valid address when posting.

  Finally, rest assured the core design of unicorn will never change.
  It will never use new-fangled things like threads, kqueue or epoll;
  but will always remain a preforking server serving one client
  per-process.

  [1] http://mid.gmane.org/20090211230457.GB22926@dcvr.yhbt.net
  [2] this would've been like, totally gnarly in the 80s!

=== unicorn 5.0.0.pre2 - another prerelease! / 2015-07-06 21:37 UTC

  There is a minor TCP socket options are now applied to inherited
  sockets, and we have native support for inheriting sockets from
  systemd (by emulating the sd_listen_fds(3) function).

  Dynamic changes in the application to Rack::Utils::HTTP_STATUS
  codes is now supported, so you can use your own custom status
  lines.

  Ruby 2.2 and later is now favored for performance.
  Optimizations by using constants which made sense in earlier
  versions of Ruby are gone: so users of old Ruby versions
  will see performance regressions.  Ruby 2.2 users should
  see the same or better performance, and we have less code
  as a result.

  * doc: update some invalid URLs
  * apply TCP socket options on inherited sockets
  * reflect changes in Rack::Utils::HTTP_STATUS_CODES
  * reduce constants and optimize for Ruby 2.2
  * http_response: reduce size of multi-line header path
  * emulate sd_listen_fds for systemd support
  * test/unit/test_response.rb: compatibility with older test-unit

  This also includes all changes in unicorn 5.0.0.pre1:

  http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/m/20150615225652.GA16164@dcvr.yhbt.net.html

=== unicorn 5.0.0.pre1 - incompatible changes! / 2015-06-15 22:49 UTC

  This release finally drops Ruby 1.8 support and requires Ruby 1.9.3
  or later.  The horrible "Status:" header in our HTTP response is
  finally gone, saving at least 16 precious bytes in every single HTTP
  response.

  Under Ruby 2.1 and later, the monotonic clock is used for timeout
  handling for better accuracy.

  Several experimental, unused and undocumented features are removed.

  There's also tiny, minor performance and memory improvements from
  dropping 1.8 compatibility, but probably nothing noticeable on a
  typical real-life (bloated) app.

  The biggest performance improvement we made was to our website by
  switching to olddoc.  Depending on connection speed, latency, and
  renderer performance, it typically loads two to four times faster.

  Finally, for the billionth time: unicorn must never be exposed
  to slow clients, as it will never ever use new-fangled things
  like non-blocking socket I/O, threads, epoll or kqueue.  unicorn
  must be used with a fully-buffering reverse proxy such as nginx
  for slow clients.

=== unicorn 4.9.0 - TempfileReaper support in Rack 1.6 / 2015-04-24 03:09 UTC

  This release supports the Rack::TempfileReaper middleware found
  in rack 1.6 for cleaning up disk space used by temporary files.
  We also use Rack::TempfileReaper for cleaning up large temporary
  files buffered with TeeInput.  Users on rack 1.5 and earlier
  will see no changes.

  There's also a bunch of documentation/build system improvements.

  This is likely to be the last Ruby 1.8-compatible release,
  unicorn 5.x will require 1.9.3 or later as well as dropping lots
  of cruft (the stupid "Status:" header in responses being the
  most notable).

  21 changes backported from master:

        ISSUES: update with mailing list subscription
        FAQ: add entry for Rails autoflush_log
        dev: remove isolate dependency
        unicorn.gemspec: depend on test-unit 3.0

=== unicorn 4.8.3 - the end of an era / 2014-05-07 07:50 UTC

  This release updates documentation to reflect the migration of the
  mailing list to a new public-inbox[1] instance.  This is necessary
  due to the impending RubyForge shutdown on May 15, 2014.

  The public-inbox address is: unicorn-public@bogomips.org
      (no subscription required, plain text only)
  ssoma[2] git archives: git://bogomips.org/unicorn-public
  browser-friendly archives: http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/

  Using, getting help for, and contributing to unicorn will never
  require any of the following:

  1) non-Free software (including SaaS)
  2) registration or sign-in of any kind
  3) a real identity (we accept mail from Mixmaster)
  4) a graphical user interface

  Nowadays, plain-text email is the only ubiquitous platform which
  meets all our requirements for communication.

  There is also one small bugfix to handle premature grandparent death
  upon initial startup.  Most users are unaffected.

  [1] policy: http://public-inbox.org/ - git://80x24.org/public-inbox
      an "archives first" approach to mailing lists
  [2] mechanism: http://ssoma.public-inbox.org/ - git://80x24.org/ssoma
      some sort of mail archiver (using git)

=== unicorn 4.8.2 - avoid race condition during worker startup / 2014-02-05 18:24 UTC

  We close SELF_PIPE in the worker immediately, but signal handlers
  do not get setup immediately.  So prevent workers from erroring out
  due to invalid SELF_PIPE.

=== unicorn 4.8.1 / 2014-01-29 08:48 UTC

  fix races/error handling in worker SIGQUIT handler

  This protects us from two problems:

  1) we (or our app) somehow called IO#close on one of the sockets
     we listen on without removing it from the readers array.
     We'll ignore IOErrors from IO#close and assume we wanted to
     close it.

  2) our SIGQUIT handler is interrupted by itself.  This can happen as
     a fake signal from the master could be handled and a real signal
     from an outside user is sent to us (e.g. from unicorn-worker-killer)
     or if a user uses the killall(1) command.

=== unicorn 4.8.0 - big internal changes, but compatible / 2014-01-11 07:34 UTC

  This release contains fairly major internal workings of master-to-worker
  notifications.  The master process no longer sends signals to workers
  for most tasks.  This works around some compatibility issues with some
  versions of the "pg" gem (and potentially any other code which may not
  handle EINTR properly).  One extra benefit is it also helps stray
  workers notice a rare, unexpected master death more easily.  Workers
  continue to (and will always) accept existing signals for compatibility
  with tools/scripts which may signal workers.

  PID file are always written early (even on upgrade) again to avoid
  breaking strange monitoring setups which use PID files.  Keep in mind we
  have always discouraged monitoring based on PID files as they are
  fragile.

  We now avoid bubbling IOError to the Rack app on premature client
  disconnects when streaming the input body.  This is usually not a
  problem with nginx, but may be on some LAN setups without nginx).

  Thanks to Sam Saffron, Jimmy Soho, Rodrigo Rosenfeld Rosas,
  Michael Fischer, and Andrew Hobson for their help with this release.

  Note: the unicorn mailing list will be moved/changed soon due to the
  RubyForge shutdown.  unicorn will always rely only on Free Software.
  There will never be any sign-up requirements nor terms-of-service to
  agree to when communicating with us.

=== unicorn 4.8.0pre1 / 2013-12-09 09:51 UTC

  Eric Wong (6):
        tests: fix SO_REUSEPORT tests for old Linux and non-Linux
        stream_input: avoid IO#close on client disconnect
        t0300: kill off stray processes in test
        always write PID file early for compatibility
        doc: clarify SIGNALS and reference init example
        rework master-to-worker signaling to use a pipe

=== unicorn 4.7.0 - minor updates, license tweak / 2013-11-04 06:59 UTC

  * support SO_REUSEPORT on new listeners (:reuseport)

  This allows users to start an independent instance of unicorn on
  a the same port as a running unicorn (as long as both instances
  use :reuseport).

  ref: https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/

  * unicorn is now GPLv2-or-later and Ruby 1.8-licensed
  (instead of GPLv2-only, GPLv3-only, and Ruby 1.8-licensed)

  This changes nothing at the moment.  Once the FSF publishes the next
  version of the GPL, users may choose the newer GPL version without the
  unicorn BDFL approving it.  Two years ago when I got permission to add
  GPLv3 to the license options, I also got permission from all past
  contributors to approve future versions of the GPL.  So now I'm
  approving all future versions of the GPL for use with unicorn.

  Reasoning below:

  In case the GPLv4 arrives and I am not alive to approve/review it,
  the lesser of evils is have give blanket approval of all future GPL
  versions (as published by the FSF).  The worse evil is to be stuck
  with a license which cannot guarantee the Free-ness of this project
  in the future.

  This unfortunately means the FSF can theoretically come out with
  license terms I do not agree with, but the GPLv2 and GPLv3 will
  always be an option to all users.

  Note: we currently prefer GPLv3

  Two improvements thanks to Ernest W. Durbin III:

  * USR2 redirects fixed for Ruby 1.8.6 (broken since 4.1.0)
  * unicorn(1) and unicorn_rails(1) enforces valid integer for -p/--port

  A few more odd, minor tweaks and fixes:

  * attempt to rename PID file when possible (on USR2)
  * workaround reopen atomicity issues for stdio vs non-stdio
  * improve handling of client-triggerable socket errors

=== unicorn 4.6.3 - fix --no-default-middleware option / 2013-06-21 08:01 UTC

  Thanks to Micah Chalmer for this fix.  There are also minor
  documentation updates and internal cleanups.

=== unicorn 4.6.2 - HTTP parser fix for Rainbows! / 2013-02-26 02:59 UTC

  This release fixes a bug in Unicorn::HttpParser#filter_body
  which affected some configurations of Rainbows!  There is
  also a minor size reduction in the DSO.

=== unicorn 4.6.1 - minor cleanups / 2013-02-21 08:38 UTC

  Unicorn::Const::UNICORN_VERSION is now auto-generated from
  GIT-VERSION-GEN and always correct.  Minor cleanups for
  hijacking.

=== unicorn 4.6.0 - hijacking support / 2013-02-06 11:23 UTC

  This pre-release adds hijacking support for Rack 1.5 users.
  See Rack documentation for more information about hijacking.
  There is also a new --no-default-middleware/-N option
  for the `unicorn' command to ignore RACK_ENV within unicorn
  thanks to Lin Jen-Shin.

  There are only documentation and test-portability updates
  since 4.6.0pre1, no code changes.

=== unicorn 4.6.0pre1 - hijacking support / 2013-01-29 21:05 UTC

  This pre-release adds hijacking support for Rack 1.5 users.
  See Rack documentation for more information about hijacking.
  There is also a new --no-default-middleware/-N option
  for the `unicorn' command to ignore RACK_ENV within unicorn.

=== unicorn 4.5.0 - check_client_connection option / 2012-12-07 22:59 UTC

  The new check_client_connection option allows unicorn to detect
  most disconnected local clients before potentially expensive
  application processing begins.

  This feature is useful for applications experiencing spikes of
  traffic leading to undesirable queue times, as clients will
  disconnect (and perhaps even retry, compounding the problem)
  before unicorn can even start processing the request.

  To enable this feature, add the following line to a unicorn
  config file:

        check_client_connection true

  This feature only works when nginx (or any other HTTP/1.0+
  client) is on the same machine as unicorn.

  A huge thanks to Tom Burns for implementing and testing this
  change in production with real traffic (including mitigating
  an unexpected DoS attack).

  ref: http://mid.gmane.org/CAK4qKG3rkfVYLyeqEqQyuNEh_nZ8yw0X_cwTxJfJ+TOU+y8F+w@mail.gmail.com

  This release fixes broken Rainbows! compatibility in 4.5.0pre1.

=== unicorn 4.5.0pre1 - check_client_connection option / 2012-11-29 23:48 UTC

  The new check_client_connection option allows unicorn to detect
  most disconnected clients before potentially expensive
  application processing begins.

  This feature is useful for applications experiencing spikes of
  traffic leading to undesirable queue times, as clients will
  disconnect (and perhaps even retry, compounding the problem)
  before unicorn can even start processing the request.

  To enable this feature, add the following line to a unicorn
  config file:

    check_client_connection true

  A huge thanks to Tom Burns for implementing and testing this
  change in production with real traffic (including mitigating
  an unexpected DoS attack).

=== unicorn 4.4.0 - minor updates / 2012-10-11 09:11 UTC

  Non-regular files are no longer reopened on SIGUSR1.  This
  allows users to specify FIFOs as log destinations.

  TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK is no longer set/unset by default.  Use
  :tcp_nopush explicitly with the "listen" directive if you wish
  to enable TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK.

  Listen sockets are now bound _after_ loading the application for
  preload_app(true) users.  This prevents load balancers from
  sending traffic to an application server while the application
  is still loading.

  There are also minor test suite cleanups.

=== unicorn 4.3.1 - shutdown() fixes / 2012-04-29 07:04 UTC

  * Call shutdown(2) if a client EOFs on us during upload.
    We can avoid holding a socket open if the Rack app forked a
    process during uploads.

  * ignore potential Errno::ENOTCONN errors (from shutdown(2)).
    Even on LANs, connections can occasionally be accept()-ed but
    be unusable afterwards.

  Thanks to Joel Nimety <jnimety@continuity.net>,
  Matt Smith <matt@nearapogee.com> and George <lists@southernohio.net>
  on the mongrel-unicorn@rubyforge.org mailing list for their
  feedback and testing for this release.

=== unicorn 4.3.0 - minor fixes and updates / 2012-04-17 21:51 UTC

  * PATH_INFO (aka REQUEST_PATH) increased to 4096 (from 1024).
    This allows requests with longer path components and matches
    the system PATH_MAX value common to GNU/Linux systems for
    serving filesystem components with long names.

  * Apps that fork() (but do not exec()) internally for background
    tasks now indicate the end-of-request immediately after
    writing the Rack response.

  Thanks to Hongli Lai, Lawrence Pit, Patrick Wenger and Nuo Yan
  for their valuable feedback for this release.

=== unicorn 4.2.1 - minor fix and doc updates / 2012-03-26 21:39 UTC

  * Stale pid files are detected if a pid is recycled by processes
    belonging to another user, thanks to Graham Bleach.
  * nginx example config updates thanks to to Eike Herzbach.
  * KNOWN_ISSUES now documents issues with apps/libs that install
    conflicting signal handlers.

=== unicorn 4.2.0 / 2012-01-28 09:18 UTC

  The GPLv3 is now an option to the Unicorn license.  The existing GPLv2
  and Ruby-only terms will always remain options, but the GPLv3 is
  preferred.

  Daemonization is correctly detected on all terminals for development
  use (Brian P O'Rourke).

  Unicorn::OobGC respects applications that disable GC entirely
  during application dispatch (Yuichi Tateno).

  Many test fixes for OpenBSD, which may help other *BSDs, too.
  (Jeremy Evans).

  There is now _optional_ SSL support (via the "kgio-monkey"
  RubyGem).  On fast, secure LANs, SSL is only intended for
  detecting data corruption that weak TCP checksums cannot detect.
  Our SSL support is remains unaudited by security experts.

  There are also some minor bugfixes and documentation
  improvements.

  Ruby 2.0.0dev also has a copy-on-write friendly GC which can save memory
  when combined with "preload_app true", so if you're in the mood, start
  testing Unicorn with the latest Ruby!

=== unicorn 4.1.1 - fix last-resort timeout accuracy / 2011-08-25 21:30 UTC

  The last-resort timeout mechanism was inaccurate and often
  delayed in activation since the 2.0.0 release.  It is now fixed
  and remains power-efficient in idle situations, especially with
  the wakeup reduction in MRI 1.9.3+.

  There is also a new document on application timeouts
  intended to discourage the reliance on this last-resort
  mechanism.  It is visible on the web at:

    http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Application_Timeouts.html

=== unicorn 4.1.0 - small updates and fixes / 2011-08-20 00:33 UTC

  * Rack::Chunked and Rack::ContentLength middlewares are loaded
    by default for RACK_ENV=(development|deployment) users to match
    Rack::Server behavior.  As before, use RACK_ENV=none if you want
    fine-grained control of your middleware.  This should also
    help users of Rainbows! and Zbatery.

  * CTL characters are now rejected from HTTP header values

  * Exception messages are now filtered for [:cntrl:] characters
    since application/middleware authors may forget to do so

  * Workers will now terminate properly if a SIGQUIT/SIGTERM/SIGINT
    is received while during worker process initialization.

  * close-on-exec is explicitly disabled to future-proof against
    Ruby 2.0 changes [ruby-core:38140]

=== unicorn 4.0.1 - regression bugfixes / 2011-06-29 18:59 UTC

  This release fixes things for users of per-worker "listen"
  directives in the after_fork hook.  Thanks to ghazel@gmail.com
  for reporting the bug.

  The "timeout" configurator directive is now truncated to
  0x7ffffffe seconds to prevent overflow when calling
  IO.select.

=== unicorn 4.0.0 - for mythical hardware! / 2011-06-27 09:05 UTC

  A single Unicorn instance may manage more than 1024 workers
  without needing privileges to modify resource limits.  As a
  result of this, the "raindrops"[1] gem/library is now a required
  dependency.

  TCP socket defaults now favor low latency to mimic UNIX domain
  socket behavior (tcp_nodelay: true, tcp_nopush: false).  This
  hurts throughput, users who want to favor throughput should
  specify "tcp_nodelay: false, tcp_nopush: true" in the listen
  directive.

  Error logging is more consistent and all lines should be
  formatted correctly in backtraces.  This may break the
  behavior of some log parsers.

  The call stack is smaller and thus easier to examine backtraces
  when debugging Rack applications.

  There are some internal API changes and cleanups, but none that
  affect applications designed for Rack.  See "git log v3.7.0.."
  for details.

  For users who cannot install kgio[2] or raindrops, Unicorn 1.1.x
  remains supported indefinitely.  Unicorn 3.x will remain
  supported if there is demand.  We expect raindrops to introduce
  fewer portability problems than kgio did, however.

  [1] http://raindrops.bogomips.org/
  [2] http://bogomips.org/kgio/

=== unicorn 3.7.0 - minor feature update / 2011-06-09 20:51 UTC

  * miscellaneous documentation improvements
  * return 414 (instead of 400) for Request-URI Too Long
  * strip leading and trailing linear whitespace in header values

  User-visible improvements meant for Rainbows! users:

  * add :ipv6only "listen" option (same as nginx)

=== unicorn 3.6.2 - fix Unicorn::OobGC module / 2011-04-30 06:40 UTC

  The optional Unicorn::OobGC module is reimplemented to fix
  breakage that appeared in v3.3.1.  There are also minor
  documentation updates, but no code changes as of 3.6.1 for
  non-OobGC users.

  There is also a v1.1.7 release to fix the same OobGC breakage
  that appeared for 1.1.x users in the v1.1.6 release.

=== unicorn 1.1.7 - major fixes to minor components / 2011-04-30 06:33 UTC

  No changes to the core code, so this release only affects users
  of the Unicorn::OobGC and Unicorn::ExecCGI modules.
  Unicorn::OobGC was totally broken by the fix in the v1.1.6
  release and is now reimplemented.  Unicorn::ExecCGI (which
  hardly anybody uses) now returns proper HTTP status codes.

=== unicorn 3.6.1 - fix OpenSSL PRNG workaround / 2011-04-26 23:06 UTC

  Our attempt in 3.6.0 to workaround a problem with the OpenSSL
  PRNG actually made the problem worse.  This release corrects the
  workaround to properly reseed the OpenSSL PRNG after forking.

=== unicorn 3.6.0 - small fixes, PRNG workarounds / 2011-04-21 06:46 UTC

  Mainly small fixes, improvements, and workarounds for fork() issues
  with pseudo-random number generators shipped with Ruby (Kernel#rand,
  OpenSSL::Random (used by SecureRandom and also by Rails).

  The PRNG issues are documented in depth here (and links to Ruby Redmine):

    http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git/commit?id=1107ede7
    http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git/commit?id=b3241621

  If you're too lazy to upgrade, you can just do this in your after_fork
  hooks:

    after_fork do |server,worker|
      tmp = srand
      OpenSSL::Random.seed(tmp.to_s) if defined?(OpenSSL::Random)
    end

  There are also small log reopening (SIGUSR1) improvements:

  * relative paths may also be reopened, there's a small chance this
    will break with a handful of setups, but unlikely.  This should
    make configuration easier especially since the "working_directory"
    configurator directive exists.  Brought up by Matthew Kocher:
    http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.unicorn.general/900

  * workers will just die (and restart) if log reopening fails for
    any reason (including user error).  This is to workaround the issue
    reported by Emmanuel Gomez:
    http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.unicorn.general/906

=== unicorn 3.5.0 - very minor improvements / 2011-03-15 12:27 UTC

  A small set of small changes but it's been more than a month
  since our last release.  There are minor memory usage and
  efficiently improvements (for graceful shutdowns).  MRI 1.8.7
  users on *BSD should be sure they're using the latest patchlevel
  (or upgrade to 1.9.x) because we no longer workaround their
  broken stdio (that's MRI's job :)

=== unicorn 3.4.0 - for people with very big LANs / 2011-02-04 21:23 UTC

  * IPv6 support in the HTTP hostname parser and configuration
    language.  Configurator syntax for "listen" addresses should
    be the same as nginx.  Even though we support IPv6, we will
    never support non-LAN/localhost clients connecting to Unicorn.

  * TCP_NOPUSH/TCP_CORK is enabled by default to optimize
    for bandwidth usage and avoid unnecessary wakeups in nginx.

  * Updated KNOWN_ISSUES document for bugs in recent Ruby 1.8.7
    (RNG needs reset after fork) and nginx+sendfile()+FreeBSD 8.

  * examples/nginx.conf updated for modern stable versions of nginx.

  * "Status" in headers no longer ignored in the response,
    Rack::Lint already enforces this so we don't duplicate
    the work.

  * All tests pass under Ruby 1.9.3dev

  * various bugfixes in the (mostly unused) ExecCGI class that
    powers http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git

=== unicorn 3.3.1 - one minor, esoteric bugfix / 2011-01-06 23:48 UTC

  We now close the client socket after closing the response body.
  This does not affect most applications that run under Unicorn,
  in fact, it may not affect any.

  There is also a new v1.1.6 release for users who do not use
  kgio.

=== unicorn 1.1.6 - one minor, esoteric bugfix / 2011-01-06 23:46 UTC

  We now close the client socket after closing the response body.
  This does not affect most applications that run under Unicorn,
  in fact, it may not affect any.

=== unicorn 3.3.0 - minor optimizations / 2011-01-05 23:43 UTC

  Certain applications that already serve hundreds/thousands of requests a
  second should experience performance improvements due to
  Time.now.httpdate usage being removed and reimplemented in C.

  There are also minor internal changes and cleanups for Rainbows!

=== unicorn 3.2.1 - parser improvements for Rainbows! / 2010-12-26 08:04 UTC

  There are numerous improvements in the HTTP parser for
  Rainbows!, none of which affect Unicorn-only users.

  The kgio dependency is incremented to 2.1: this should avoid
  ENOSYS errors for folks building binaries on newer Linux
  kernels and then deploying to older ones.

  There are also minor documentation improvements, the website
  is now JavaScript-free!

  (Ignore the 3.2.0 release, I fat-fingered some packaging things)

=== unicorn 3.2.0 - parser improvements for Rainbows! / 2010-12-26 07:50 UTC

  There are numerous improvements in the HTTP parser for

=== unicorn 3.1.0 - client_buffer_body_size tuning / 2010-12-09 22:28 UTC

  This release enables tuning the client_buffer_body_size to raise
  or lower the threshold for buffering request bodies to disk.
  This only applies to users who have not disabled rewindable
  input.  There is also a TeeInput bugfix for uncommon usage
  patterns and Configurator examples in the FAQ should be fixed

=== unicorn 3.0.1 - one bugfix for Rainbows! / 2010-12-03 00:34 UTC

  ...and only Rainbows!  This release fixes HTTP pipelining for
  requests with bodies for users of synchronous Rainbows!
  concurrency models.

  Since Unicorn itself does not support keepalive nor pipelining,
  Unicorn-only users need not upgrade.

=== unicorn 3.0.0 - disable rewindable input! / 2010-11-20 02:41 UTC

  Rewindable "rack.input" may be disabled via the
  "rewindable_input false" directive in the configuration file.
  This will violate Rack::Lint for Rack 1.x applications, but can
  reduce I/O for applications that do not need a rewindable
  input.

  This release updates us to the Kgio 2.x series which should play
  more nicely with other libraries and applications.  There are
  also internal cleanups and improvements for future versions of
  Rainbows!

  The Unicorn 3.x series supercedes the 2.x series
  while the 1.x series will remain supported indefinitely.

=== unicorn 3.0.0pre2 - less bad than 2.x or 3.0.0pre1! / 2010-11-19 00:07 UTC

  This release updates us to the Kgio 2.x series which should play
  more nicely with other applications.  There are also bugfixes
  from the 2.0.1 release and a small bugfix to the new StreamInput
  class.

  The Unicorn 3.x series will supercede the 2.x series
  while the 1.x series will remain supported indefinitely.

=== unicorn 2.0.1 - fix errors in error handling / 2010-11-17 23:48 UTC

  This release fixes errors in our own error handling,
  causing certain errors to not be logged nor responded
  to correctly.

  Eric Wong (3):
        t0012: fix race condition in reload
        http_server: fix HttpParserError constant resolution
        tests: add parser error test from Rainbows!

=== unicorn 3.0.0pre1 / 2010-11-17 00:04 UTC

  Rewindable "rack.input" may be disabled via the
  "rewindable_input false" directive in the configuration file.
  This will violate Rack::Lint for Rack 1.x applications, but
  can reduce I/O for applications that do not need it.

  There are also internal cleanups and enhancements for future
  versions of Rainbows!

  Eric Wong (11):
        t0012: fix race condition in reload
        enable HTTP keepalive support for all methods
        http_parser: add HttpParser#next? method
        tee_input: switch to simpler API for parsing trailers
        switch versions to 3.0.0pre
        add stream_input class and build tee_input on it
        configurator: enable "rewindable_input" directive
        http_parser: ensure keepalive is disabled when reset
        *_input: make life easier for subclasses/modules
        tee_input: restore read position after #size
        preread_input: no-op for non-rewindable "rack.input"

=== unicorn 2.0.0 - mostly internal cleanups / 2010-10-27 23:44 UTC

  Despite the version number, this release mostly features
  internal cleanups for future versions of Rainbows!.  User
  visible changes include reductions in CPU wakeups on idle sites
  using high timeouts.

  Barring possible portability issues due to the introduction of
  the kgio library, this release should be ready for all to use.
  However, 1.1.x (and possibly 1.0.x) will continue to be
  maintained.  Unicorn 1.1.5 and 1.0.2 have also been released
  with bugfixes found during development of 2.0.0.

=== unicorn 1.1.5 / 2010-10-27 23:30 UTC

  This maintenance release fixes several long-standing but
  recently-noticed bugs.  SIGHUP reloading now correctly restores
  default values if they're erased or commented-out in the Unicorn
  configuration file.  Delays/slowdowns in signal handling since
  0.990 are fixed, too.

=== unicorn 1.0.2 / 2010-10-27 23:12 UTC

  This is the latest maintenance release of the 1.0.x series.
  All users are encouraged to upgrade to 1.1.x stable series
  and report bugs there.

  Shortlog of changes since 1.0.1:

  Eric Wong (8):
        SIGTTIN works after SIGWINCH
        fix delays in signal handling
        Rakefile: don't post freshmeat on empty changelogs
        Rakefile: capture prerelease tags
        configurator: use "__send__" instead of "send"
        configurator: reloading with unset values restores default
        gemspec: depend on Isolate 3.0.0 for dev
        doc: stop using deprecated rdoc CLI options

=== unicorn 2.0.0pre3 - more small fixes / 2010-10-09 00:06 UTC

  There is a new Unicorn::PrereadInput middleware to which allows
  input bodies to be drained off the socket and buffered to disk
  (or memory) before dispatching the application.

  HTTP Pipelining behavior is fixed for Rainbows!  There
  are some small Kgio fixes and updates for Rainbows!
  users as well.

=== unicorn 2.0.0pre2 - releases are cheap / 2010-10-07 07:23 UTC

  Internal changes/cleanups for Rainbows!

=== unicorn 2.0.0pre1 - a boring "major" release / 2010-10-06 01:17 UTC

  Mostly internal cleanups for future versions of Rainbows! and
  people trying out Rubinius.  There are tiny performance
  improvements for Ruby 1.9.2 users which may only be noticeable
  with Rainbows!.

  There is a new dependency on the "kgio" library for kinder,
  gentler I/O :)  Please report any bugs and portability issues
  with kgio to the Unicorn mailing list[1].

  Unicorn 1.1.x users are NOT required nor even encouraged to
  upgrade yet.  Unicorn 1.1.x will be maintained for the
  forseeable future.

  [1] - mongrel-unicorn@rubyforge.org

=== unicorn 1.1.4 - small bug fix and doc updates / 2010-10-04 20:32 UTC

  We no longer unlinking actively listening sockets upon startup
  (but continue to unlink dead ones).  This bug could trigger
  downtime and nginx failures if a user makes an error and
  attempts to start Unicorn while it is already running.

  Thanks to Jordan Ritter for the detailed bug report leading to
  this fix.

  ref: http://mid.gmane.org/8D95A44B-A098-43BE-B532-7D74BD957F31@darkridge.com

  There are also minor documentation and test updates pulled in
  from master.  This is hopefully the last bugfix release of the
  1.1.x series.

=== unicorn 1.1.3 - small bug fixes / 2010-08-28 19:27 UTC

  This release fixes race conditions during SIGUSR1 log cycling.
  This bug mainly affects Rainbows! users serving static files,
  but some Rack apps use threads internally even under Unicorn.

  Other small fixes:
  * SIGTTIN works as documented after SIGWINCH
  * --help output from `unicorn` and `unicorn_rails` is more consistent

=== unicorn 1.1.2 - fixing upgrade rollbacks / 2010-07-13 20:04 UTC

  This release is fixes a long-standing bug where the original PID
  file is not restored when rolling back from a USR2 upgrade.
  Presumably most upgrades aren't rolled back, so it took over a
  year to notice this issue.  Thanks to Lawrence Pit for
  discovering and reporting this issue.

=== unicorn 1.0.1 - bugfixes only / 2010-07-13 20:01 UTC

  The first maintenance release of 1.0.x, this release is
  primarily to fix a long-standing bug where the original PID file
  is not restored when rolling back from a USR2 upgrade.
  Presumably most upgrades aren't rolled back, so it took over a
  year to notice this issue.  Thanks to Lawrence Pit for
  discovering and reporting this issue.

  There is also a pedantic TeeInput bugfix which shouldn't affect
  real apps from the 1.1.x series and a test case fix for OSX,
  too.

=== unicorn 1.1.1 - fixing cleanups gone bad :x / 2010-07-11 02:13 UTC

  Unicorn::TeeInput constant resolution for Unicorn::ClientError
  got broken simplifying code for RDoc.  This affects users
  of Rainbows! and Zbatery.

=== unicorn 1.1.0 - small changes and cleanups / 2010-07-08 07:57 UTC

  This is a small, incremental feature release with some internal
  changes to better support upcoming versions of the Rainbows! and
  Zbatery web servers.  There is no need to upgrade if you're
  happy with 1.0.0, but also little danger in upgrading.

  There is one pedantic bugfix which shouldn't affect anyone
  and small documentation updates as well.

=== unicorn 1.0.0 - yes, this is a real project / 2010-06-17 09:18 UTC

  There are only minor changes since 0.991.0.

  For users clinging onto the past, MRI 1.8.6 support has been
  restored.  Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the
  latest 1.8.7, REE or 1.9.1.

  For users looking towards the future, the core test suite and
  the Rails 3 (beta) integration tests pass entirely under 1.9.2
  preview3.  As of the latest rubinius.git[1], Rubinius support is
  nearly complete as well.

  Under Rubinius, signals may corrupt responses as they're being
  written to the socket, but that should be fixable transparently
  to us[4].  Support for the hardly used, hardly documented[2]
  embedded command-line switches in rackup config (.ru) files is
  is also broken under Rubinius.

  The recently-released Rack 1.2.1 introduced no compatiblity
  issues[3] in core Unicorn.  We remain compatible with all Rack
  releases starting with 0.9.1 (and possibly before).

  [1] tested with Rubinius upstream commit
  cf4a5a759234faa3f7d8a92d68fa89d8c5048f72
  [2] lets avoid the Dueling Banjos effect here :x
  [3] actually, Rack 1.2.1 is broken under 1.8.6.
  [4] http://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/issues/373

=== unicorn 0.991.0 - startup improvements / 2010-06-11 02:18 UTC

  The "working_directory" configuration parameter is now handled
  before config.ru.  That means "unicorn" and "unicorn_rails" no
  longer barfs when initially started outside of the configured
  "working_directory" where a config.ru is required.  A huge
  thanks to Pierre Baillet for catching this ugly UI inconsistency
  before the big 1.0 release

  Thanks to Hongli Lai, out-of-the-box Rails 3 (beta) support
  should be improved for deployments lacking a config.ru

  There are more new integration tests, cleanups and some
  documentation improvements.

=== unicorn 0.990.0 - inching towards 1.0 / 2010-06-08 09:41 UTC

  Thanks to Augusto Becciu for finding a bug in the HTTP parser
  that caused a TypeError (and 500) when a rare client set the
  "Version:" header which conflicts with the HTTP_VERSION header
  we parse in the first line of the request[1].

  Horizontal tabs are now allowed as leading whitespace in header
  values as according to RFC 2616 as pointed out by
  Iñaki Baz Castillo[2].

  Taking a hint from Rack 1.1, the "logger" configuration
  parameter no longer requires a "close" method.  This means some
  more Logger replacements may be used.

  There's a new, optional, Unicorn (and maybe Passenger)-only
  middleware, Unicorn::OobGC[2] that runs GC outside of the normal
  request/response cycle to help out memory-hungry applications.
  Thanks to Luke Melia for being brave enough to test and report
  back on my big_app_gc.rb monkey patch[3] which lead up to this.

  Rails 3 (beta) support:

    Using "unicorn" is still recommended as Rails 3 comes with
    a config.ru, but "unicorn_rails" is cleaned up a bit and
    *should* work as well as "unicorn" out-of-the-box.  Feedback
    is much appreciated.

  Rubinius updates:

    USR2 binary upgrades are broken due to
    {TCPServer,UNIXServer}.for_fd[5][6] being broken
    (differently).

    Repeatedly hitting the server with signals in a tight
    loop is unusual and not recommended[7].

    There are some workarounds and general code cleanups for other
    issues[8], as well but things should generally work unless you
    need USR2 upgrades.  Feedback and reports would be greatly
    appreciated as usual.

  MRI support:

    All tests (except old Rails) run and pass under 1.9.2-preview3.
    1.8.7 and 1.9.1 work well as usual and will continue to be
    supported indefinitely.

  Lets hope this is the last release before 1.0.  Please report
  any issues on the mailing list[9] or email us privately[a].

=== unicorn 0.99.0 - simplicity wins / 2010-05-06 19:32 UTC

  Starting with this release, we'll always load Rack up front at
  startup.

  Previously we had complicated ways to avoid loading Rack until
  after the application was loaded to allow the application to
  load an alternate version of Rack.  However this has proven too
  error-prone to be worth supporting even though Unicorn does not
  have strict requirements on currently released Rack versions.

  If an app requires a different version of Rack than what Unicorn
  would load by default, it is recommended they only install that
  version of Rack (and no others) since Unicorn does not have any
  strict requirements on currently released Rack versions.

  Rails 2.3.x users should be aware of this as those versions are
  not compatible with Rack 1.1.0.

  If it is not possible to only have one Rack version installed
  "globally", then they should either use Isolate or Bundler and
  install a private version of Unicorn along with their preferred
  version of Rack.  Users who install in this way are recommended
  to execute the isolated/bundled version of Unicorn, instead of
  what would normally be in $PATH.

  Feedback/tips to mailto:mongrel-unicorn@rubyforge.org from
  Isolate and Bundler users would be greatly appreciated.

=== unicorn 0.98.0 / 2010-05-05 00:53 UTC

  Deployments that suspend or hibernate servers should no longer
  have workers killed off (and restarted) upon resuming.

  For Linux users of {raindrops}[http://raindrops.bogomips.org/]
  (v0.2.0+) configuration is easier as raindrops can now
  automatically detect the active listeners on the server
  via the new Unicorn.listener_names singleton method.

  For the pedantic, chunked request bodies without trailers are no
  longer allowed to omit the final CRLF.  This shouldn't affect
  any real and RFC-compliant clients out there.  Chunked requests
  with trailers have always worked and continue to work the same
  way.

  The rest are mostly small internal cleanups and documentation
  fixes.  See the commit logs for full details.

=== unicorn 0.97.1 - fix HTTP parser for Rainbows!/Zbatery / 2010-04-19 21:00 UTC

  This release fixes a denial-of-service vector for derived
  servers exposed directly to untrusted clients.

  This bug does not affect most Unicorn deployments as Unicorn is
  only supported with trusted clients (such as nginx) on a LAN.
  nginx is known to reject clients that send invalid
  Content-Length headers, so any deployments on a trusted LAN
  and/or behind nginx are safe.

  Servers affected by this bug include (but are not limited to)
  Rainbows! and Zbatery.  This bug does not affect Thin nor
  Mongrel, as neither got the request body filtering treatment
  that the Unicorn HTTP parser got in August 2009.

  The bug fixed in this release could result in a
  denial-of-service as it would trigger a process-wide assertion
  instead of raising an exception.  For servers such as
  Rainbows!/Zbatery that serve multiple clients per worker
  process, this could abort all clients connected to the
  particular worker process that hit the assertion.

=== unicorn 0.97.0 - polishing and cleaning up / 2010-03-01 18:26 UTC

  A bunch of small fixes related to startup/configuration and hot
  reload issues with HUP:

  * Variables in the user-generated config.ru files no longer
    risk clobbering variables used in laucher scripts.

  * signal handlers are initialized before the pid file is
    dropped, so over-eager firing of init scripts won't
    mysteriously nuke a process.

  * SIGHUP will return app to original state if an updated
    config.ru fails to load due to {Syntax,Load}Error.

  * unicorn_rails should be Rails 3 compatible out-of-the-box
    ('unicorn' works as always, and is recommended for Rails 3)

  * unicorn_rails is finally "working_directory"-aware when
    generating default temporary paths and pid file

  * config.ru encoding is the application's default in 1.9,
    not forced to binary like many parts of Unicorn.

  * configurator learned to handle the "user" directive outside
    of after_fork hook (which will always remain supported).

  There are also various internal cleanups and possible speedups.

=== unicorn 0.96.1 - fix leak in Rainbows!/Zbatery / 2010-02-13 08:35 UTC

  This maintenance release is intended for users of Rainbows! and
  Zbatery servers (and anybody else using Unicorn::HttpParser).

  This memory leak DID NOT affect Unicorn itself: Unicorn always
  allocates the HttpParser once and always reuses it in every
  sequential request.

  This leak affects applications that repeatedly allocate a new
  HTTP parser.  Thus this bug affects _all_ deployments of
  Rainbows! and Zbatery.  These servers allocate a new parser for
  every client connection to serve clients concurrently.

  I misread the Data_Make_Struct()/Data_Wrap_Struct()
  documentation and ended up passing NULL as the "free" argument
  instead of -1, causing the memory to never be freed.

  From README.EXT in the MRI source which I misread:
  > The free argument is the function to free the pointer
  > allocation.  If this is -1, the pointer will be just freed.
  > The functions mark and free will be called from garbage
  > collector.

=== unicorn 0.96.0 - Rack 1.1 bump / 2010-01-08 05:18 UTC

  This release includes small changes for things allowed by Rack
  1.1.  It is also now easier to detect if daemonized process
  fails to start.  Manpages received some minor updates as well.

  Rack 1.1 allowed us to make the following environment changes:

  * "rack.logger" is now set to the "logger" specified in
    the Unicorn config file.  This defaults to a Logger
    instance pointing to $stderr.

  * "rack.version" is now at [1,1].  Unicorn remains
    compatible with previous Rack versions if your app
    depends on it.

  While only specified since Rack 1.1, Unicorn has always exposed
  "rack.input" in binary mode (and has ridiculous integration
  tests that go outside of Ruby to prove it!).

=== unicorn 0.95.3 / 2009-12-21 21:51 UTC

  The HTTP parser now allows (but does not parse) the userinfo
  component in the very rare requests that send absoluteURIs.
  Thanks to Scott Chacon for reporting and submitting a test case
  for this fix.

  There are also minor documentation updates and tiny cleanups.

=== unicorn 0.95.2 / 2009-12-07 09:52 UTC

  Small fixes to our HTTP parser to allows semicolons in PATH_INFO
  as allowed by RFC 2396, section 3.3.  This is low impact for
  existing apps as semicolons are rarely seen in URIs.  Our HTTP
  parser runs properly under Rubinius 0.13.0 and 1.0.0-rc1 again
  (though not yet the rest of the server since we rely heavily on
  signals).

  Another round of small documentation tweaks and minor cleanups.

=== unicorn 0.95.1 / 2009-11-21 21:13 UTC

  Configuration files paths given on the command-line are no
  longer expanded.  This should make configuration reloads
  possible when a non-absolute path is specified for --config-file
  and Unicorn was deployed to a symlink directories (as with
  Capistrano).  Since deployments have always been strongly
  encouraged to use absolute paths in the config file, this
  change does not affect them.

  This is our first gem release using gemcutter.

  Eric Wong (3):
        SIGNALS: HUP + preload_app cannot reload app code
        Do not expand paths given on the shell
        GNUmakefile: prep release process for gemcutter

=== unicorn 0.95.0 / 2009-11-15 22:21 UTC

  Mostly internal cleanups and documentation updates.  Irrelevant
  stacktraces from client disconnects/errors while reading
  "rack.input" are now cleared to avoid unnecessary noise.  If
  user switching in workers is used, ownership of logs is now
  preserved when reopening worker logs (send USR1 only to the the
  master in this case).  The timeout config no longer affects long
  after_fork hooks or application startups.

  New features include the addition of the :umask option for the
  "listen" config directive and error reporting for non-portable
  socket options.

  No ponies have ever been harmed in our development.

=== unicorn 0.94.0 / 2009-11-05 09:52 UTC

  The HTTP parser is fix for oddly-aligned reads of trailers (this
  technically affects headers, too, but is highly unlikely due to
  our non-support of slow clients).  This allows our HTTP parser
  to better support very slow clients when used by other servers
  (like Rainbows!).  Fortunately this bug does not appear to lead
  to any invalid memory accesses (and potential arbitrary code
  execution).

  FreeBSD (and possibly other *BSDs) support is improved and and
  all the test cases pass under FreeBSD 7.2.  Various flavors of
  GNU/Linux remains our primary platform for development and
  production.

  New features added include the "working_directory" directive in
  the configurator .  Even without specifying a
  "working_directory", symlink-aware detection of the current path
  no longer depends on /bin/sh so it should work out-of-the-box on
  FreeBSD and Solaris and not just systems where /bin/sh is dash,
  ksh93 or bash.

  User-switching support is finally supported but only intended
  for use in the after_fork hook of worker processes.  Putting it
  in the after_fork hook allows allows users to set things like
  CPU affinity[1] on a per-worker basis before dropping
  privileges.  The master process retains all privileges it
  started with.

  The ENV["RACK_ENV"] (process-wide) environment variable is now
  both read and set for `unicorn' in the same way RAILS_ENV is
  used by `unicorn_rails'.  This allows the Merb launcher to read
  ENV["RACK_ENV"] in config.ru.  Other web servers already set
  this and there may be applications or libraries that already
  rely on this de facto standard.

  Eric Wong (26):

=== unicorn 0.93.5 / 2009-10-29 21:41 UTC

  This release fixes a regression introduced in 0.93.3 where
  timed-out worker processes run a chance of not being killed off
  at all if they're hung.  While it's not ever advisable to have
  requests take a long time, we realize it's easy to fix
  everything :)

=== unicorn 0.93.4 / 2009-10-27 07:57 UTC

  This release mainly works around BSD stdio compatibility issues
  that affect at least FreeBSD and OS X.  While this issues was
  documented and fixed in [ruby-core:26300][1], no production
  release of MRI 1.8 has it, and users typically upgrade MRI more
  slowly than gems.  This issue does NOT affect 1.9 users.  Thanks
  to Vadim Spivak for reporting and testing this issue and Andrey
  Stikheev for the fix.

  Additionally there are small documentation bits, one error
  handling improvement, and one minor change that should improve
  reliability of signal delivery.

=== unicorn 0.93.2 / 2009-10-07 08:45 UTC

  Avoid truncated POST bodies from with URL-encoded forms in Rails
  by switching TeeInput to use read-in-full semantics (only) when
  a Content-Length: header exists.  Chunked request bodies
  continue to exhibit readpartial semantics to support
  simultaneous bidirectional chunking.

  The lack of return value checking in Rails to protect against a
  short ios.read(length) is entirely reasonable even if not
  pedantically correct.  Most ios.read(length) implementations
  return the full amount requested except right before EOF.

  Also there are some minor documentation improvements.

=== unicorn 0.93.1 / 2009-10-03 01:17 UTC

  Fix permissions for release tarballs/gems, no other changes.
  Thanks to Jay Reitz for reporting this.

=== unicorn 0.93.0 / 2009-10-02 21:04 UTC

  The one minor bugfix is only for Rails 2.3.x+ users who set the
  RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT environment variable in a config file.
  Users of the "--path" switch or those who set the environment
  variable in the shell were unaffected by this bug.  Note that we
  still don't have relative URL root support for Rails < 2.3, and
  are unlikely to bother with it unless there is visible demand
  for it.

  New features includes support for :tries and :delay when
  specifying a "listen" in an after_fork hook.  This was inspired
  by Chris Wanstrath's example of binding per-worker listen
  sockets in a loop while migrating (or upgrading) Unicorn.
  Setting a negative value for :tries means we'll retry the listen
  indefinitely until the socket becomes available.

  So you can do something like this in an after_fork hook:

      after_fork do |server, worker|
        addr = "127.0.0.1:#{9293 + worker.nr}"
        server.listen(addr, :tries => -1, :delay => 5)
      end

  There's also the usual round of added documentation, packaging
  fixes, code cleanups, small fixes and minor performance
  improvements that are viewable in the "git log" output.

        unicorn 0.93.0

=== unicorn 0.92.0 / 2009-09-18 21:40 UTC

  Small fixes and documentation are the focus of this release.

  James Golick reported and helped me track down a bug that caused
  SIGHUP to drop the default listener (0.0.0.0:8080) if and only
  if listeners were completely unspecified in both the
  command-line and Unicorn config file.  The Unicorn config file
  remains the recommended option for specifying listeners as it
  allows fine-tuning of the :backlog, :rcvbuf, :sndbuf,
  :tcp_nopush, and :tcp_nodelay options.

  There are some documentation (and resulting website)
  improvements.  setup.rb users will notice the new section 1
  manpages for `unicorn` and `unicorn_rails`, Rubygems users
  will have to install manpages manually or use the website.

  The HTTP parser got a 3rd-party code review which resulted in
  some cleanups and one insignificant bugfix as a result.

  Additionally, the HTTP parser compiles, runs and passes unit
  tests under Rubinius.  The pure-Ruby parts still do not work yet
  and we currently lack the resources/interest to pursue this
  further but help will be gladly accepted.

  The website now has an Atom feed for new release announcements.
  Those unfamiliar with Atom or HTTP may finger unicorn@bogomips.org

=== unicorn 0.10.3r / 2009-09-09 00:09 UTC

  Removes the Rev monkey patch, rev 0.3.0 is out now so we can
  just depend on that instead of monkey patching it.  Experimental
  HTTP keepalive/pipelining support has arrived as well.

  Three features from mainline Unicorn are now working again with
  this branch:

  * Deadlocked workers can be detected by the master and nuked
  * multiple (TCP) listeners per process
  * graceful shutdown

  This (pre-)release does NOT feature HTTP/0.9 support that
  Unicorn 0.91.0 had, expect that when this branch is ready for
  merging with mainline.

=== unicorn 0.91.0 / 2009-09-04 19:04 UTC

  bodies: "Transfer-Encoding: chunked", rewindable streaming

  We now have support for "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" bodies in
  requests.  Not only that, Rack applications reading input bodies
  get that data streamed off to the client socket on an as-needed
  basis.  This allows the application to do things like upload
  progress notification and even tunneling of arbitrary stream
  protocols via bidirectional chunked encoding.

  See Unicorn::App::Inetd and examples/git.ru (including the
  comments) for an example of tunneling the git:// protocol over
  HTTP.

  This release also gives applications the ability to respond
  positively to "Expect: 100-continue" headers before being rerun
  without closing the socket connection.  See Unicorn::App::Inetd
  for an example of how this is used.

  This release is NOT recommended for production use.

  The RubyGem now has a hard dependency on Rack.  Minor performance
  improvements and code cleanups.  If RubyGems are in use, the Gem index
  is refreshed when SIGHUP is issued.

    to ensure rack.url_scheme is "https" for SSL-enabled
    sites.

  * Small cleanups and tweaks throughout, see shortlog (below)
    or changelog for details.
