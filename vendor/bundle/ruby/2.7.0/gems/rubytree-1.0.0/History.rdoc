* Released 0.9.6. This is a minor bug-fix release.

* This release allows the {Tree::TreeNode#print_tree} method to be used on
  non-root nodes. Thanks to {https://github.com/ojab Ojab}.

* The spaceship operator ('<=>') now returns 'nil' if the object being compared
  to is itself 'nil' or not another {Tree::TreeNode}.

=== 0.9.6 / 2015-05-30

* Released 0.9.6, which is same as 0.9.5, except for an update to the Gem release date.

This is a feature and bug-fix release.

==== The Features

* Rubytree now supports +postordered+ traversal via the
  {Tree::TreeNode#postordered_each} method. Thanks to
  {https://github.com/pdecourcel Paul de Courcel} for this.

* The Binary tree now supports +inorder+ traversal via the
  {Tree::BinaryTreeNode#inordered_each} method.

* Ability to merge in another tree at a chosen node, or merge two trees to
  create a third tree. Thanks to {https://github.com/dazoakley Darren Oakley}
  for this ({https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/pull/2 pull request #2})

* RubyTree now mixes in the {http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.8.7/Comparable.html
  Comparable} module.

==== The Fixes

* (Partial) fix for preventing cyclic graphs in the tree

* Refactored the {Tree::TreeNode#each} method to prevent stack errors while
  navigating deep trees
  ({https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues/12 issue #12})

* Check to ensure that the added node's name is unique to the destination tree
  ({https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/pull/9 merge #9}). Thanks to
  {https://github.com/ysf Youssef Rebahi-Gilbert} for the idea and the initial
  code

* Fix for {issue 23}[https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues/23], where the
  tree traversal on a binary tree would fail if the _left_ child was +nil+

* The traversal methods ({Tree::TreeNode#each},
  {Tree::TreeNode#preordered_each}, {Tree::TreeNode#postordered_each} and
  {Tree::TreeNode#breadth_each}) now correctly return an
  {http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.8.7/Enumerable.html Enumerator} as the
  return value when no block is given, and return the receiver node if a block was
  provided. This is consistent with how the standard Ruby collections work.

==== Other Changes

* Structural changes in the code to refactor out the non-core functions into
  modules (mostly by extracting out non-core code as mixins).

* Significant refactoring of the documentation. The {http://yardoc.org Yardoc}
  tags are now extensively used.

* Basic support built-in for including example code in the Gem. This will be
  fully expanded in the next release.

* Various changes to the {http://bundler.io bundler}, {https://travis-ci.org
  travis-ci} and other Rakefile related changes.

=== 0.8.3 / 2012-08-21

This is a primarily a bug-fix release, with some packaging changes.

* Have removed the dependency on Hoe[https://github.com/seattlerb/hoe]. The
  build is now vanilla
  {gemspec}[http://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/] based.

* Included support for {gem-testers}[http://test.rubygems.org/].

* Included support for {Bundler}[http://gembundler.com/].

* Implemented the {Tree::Utils::JSONConverter#as_json} method to support Rails'
  JSON encoding, by pulling in the changes by Eric Cline
  (https://github.com/escline).

* Partial fix for {Github Bug
  #5}[https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues/5]. This is to
  prevent infinite looping is an existing node is added again
  elsewhere in the tree.

* Fixed the issue with using +integers+ as node names, and its
  interaction with the +Tree::TreeNode#[]+ access method as documented in
  {Github Bug #6}[https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues/6].

* Clarified the need to have unique node names {Github Bug
  #7}[https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues/7] (documentation).

* Fixed {Tree::TreeNode#siblings} method to return an empty array for the
  root node as well (it returned +nil+ earlier).

=== 0.8.2 / 2011-12-15

* Minor bug-fix release to address bug #1215 ({Tree::TreeNode#to_s}
  breaks if +@content+ or +@parent.name+ is not a string).

=== 0.8.1 / 2010-10-02

* This is the public release of +R0.8.0+, with additional bug-fixes.
  Note that +R0.8.0+ will not be released separately as a publicly
  available Rubygem. All changes as listed for +R0.8.0+ are available in
  this release.

* The main change in +R0.8.0+/+R0.8.1+ is conversion of all CamelCase
  method names to snake_case. The old CamelCase method names will
  still work (to ensure backwards compatibility), but will also
  display a warning.

* The {Tree::TreeNode#add} method now accepts an optional child insertion
  point.

* The subtree from the current node can now be cloned in its entirety
  using the {Tree::TreeNode#detached_subtree_copy} method.

* A major bug-fix for {bug #28613}[http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=28613&group_id=1215&atid=4793]
  which impacted the Binarytree implementation.

* Minor code re-factoring driven by the code-smell checks using
  {reek}[https://github.com/troessner/reek].

* Inclusion of the +reek+ code-smell detection tool in the Rakefile.

=== 0.8.0 / 2010-05-04

* Updated the {Tree::TreeNode#add} method to allow the optional specification
  of an insertion position in the child array.

* Added a new method {Tree::TreeNode#detached_subtree_copy} to allow cloning
  the entire tree (this method is also aliased as +dup+).

* Converted all +CamelCase+ method names to the canonical +ruby_method_names+
  (underscore separated). The +CamelCase+ methods _can still_ be invoked, but will
  throw a {http://rug-b.rubyforge.org/structured_warnings/rdoc/ Deprecated
  warning}.
  The support for old CamelCase methods will go away some time in the future,
  so the user is advised to convert all current method invocations
  to the new names.

=== 0.7.0 / 2010-05-03

* Added new methods to report the degree statistics of a node.

* Added a convenience method alias
  {Tree::Utils::TreeMetricsHandler#level Tree::TreeNode#level} to +nodeDepth+.

* Converted the exceptions thrown on invalid arguments to
  {http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/ArgumentError.html ArgumentError}
  instead of {http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/RuntimeError.html RuntimeError}.

* Converted the documentation to {http://yardoc.org Yard} format.

* Added new methods for converting from/to {http://www.json.org JSON} formats.
  Thanks to Dirk Breuer[http://github.com/railsbros-dirk] for this
  fork[http://github.com/galaxycats/].

* Added a separate {file:API-CHANGES.rdoc} documentation file.

* Added fixes for root related edge conditions to {Tree::TreeNode#is_only_child?
  isOnlyChild?}, {Tree::TreeNode#next_sibling nextSibling},
  {Tree::TreeNode#previous_sibling previousSibling} and
  {Tree::TreeNode#remove! remove!} methods.

* Removed the 'ChangeLog' file as this can now be generated from the git logs.

* Other minor code cleanup.

=== 0.6.2 / 2010-01-30

* Updated the documentation.

=== 0.6.1 / 2010-01-04

* Changed the hard-dependency on the 'structured_warnings' RubyGem to a
  soft-dependency - which lets Rubytree still work if this RubyGem is not
  available. The rationale for this is that we should not require the user to
  install a separate library just for one single edge-case function (in this
  case, to indicate a deprecated method). However, if the library _is_ available
  on the user's system, then it will get used.

=== 0.6.0 / 2010-01-03

* Fixed the
  bug#22535[http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=22535&group_id=1215&atid=4793]
  where the {Tree::Utils::TreeMetricsHandler#depth Tree::TreeNode#depth} method
  was actually returning height+1 (not the depth).

* Marked the {Tree::Utils::TreeMetricsHandler#depth Tree::TreeNode#depth}
  method as *deprecated* (and introduced the run-time dependency on
  structured-warnings[http://github.com/schmidt/structured_warnings] gem).

=== 0.5.3 / 2009-12-31

* Cleanup of the build system to exclusively use Hoe.
* Modifications and reformatting to the documentation.
* No user visible changes.

=== 0.5.2 / 2007-12-21

* Added more test cases and enabled
  {https://github.com/seattlerb/zentest ZenTest} compatibility for the test case
  names.

=== 0.5.1 / 2007-12-20

* Minor code refactoring.

=== 0.5.0 / 2007-12-18

* Fixed the marshalling code to correctly handle non-string content.

=== 0.4.3 / 2007-10-09

* Changes to the build mechanism (now uses
{http://www.zenspider.com/projects/hoe.html Hoe}).

=== 0.4.2 / 2007-10-01

* Minor code refactoring. Changes in the Rakefile.
