= kgio Hacker's Guide

=== Documentation

Please wrap documentation at 72 characters-per-line or less (long URLs
are exempt) so it is comfortably readable from terminals.

When referencing mailing list posts, use
<tt>https://yhbt.net/kgio-public/$MESSAGE_ID/</tt> if possible
Message-ID remains searchable even if the archive becomes unavailable.

=== Code Compatibility

We target mainline Ruby 1.9.3 and later.

All of our C code should be compatible with all reasonably modern Unices
and should run on compilers supported by the versions of Ruby we target.

We will NEVER support non-Free platforms under any circumstances.

Our C code follows Linux kernel coding style (hard tabs, tabs are always 8
characters wide) and NOT the indentation style of Matz Ruby.

== Contributing

Contributions are welcome in the form of patches, pull requests, code
review, testing, documentation, user support or any other feedback.  The
{kgio mailing list}[mailto:kgio-public@yhbt.net] is the
central coordination point for all user and developer feedback and bug
reports.

=== Submitting Patches

Follow conventions already established in the code and do not exceed 80
characters per line.

Inline patches (from "git format-patch -M") to the mailing list are
preferred because they allow code review and comments in the reply to
the patch.

We will adhere to mostly the same conventions for patch submissions as
git itself.  See the Documentation/SubmittingPatches document
distributed with git on on patch submission guidelines to follow.  Just
don't email the git mailing list or maintainer with kgio patches :)

== Running Development Versions

It is easy to install the contents of your git working directory:

Via RubyGems:

  gmake install-gem

Without RubyGems (via setup.rb):

  gmake install

It is not at all recommended to mix a RubyGems installation with an
installation done without RubyGems, however.

=== Tests

We use GNU make to run tests in parallel for historical reasons.  Users
of GNU-based systems (such as GNU/Linux) usually have GNU make installed
as "make" instead of "gmake".

Running the entire test suite with 4 tests in parallel:

  gmake -j4 test

Running just one unit test:

  gmake test/test_poll.rb
