Rinku does linking
==================

Rinku is a Ruby library that does autolinking.
It parses text and turns anything that remotely resembles a link into an HTML link,
just like the Ruby on Rails `auto_link` method -- but it's about 20 times faster,
because it's written in C, and it's about 20 times smarter when linking,
because it does actual parsing instead of RegEx replacements.

Rinku is a Ruby Gem 
-------------------

Rinku is available as a Ruby gem:

    $ [sudo] gem install rinku

The Rinku source is available at GitHub:

    $ git clone git://github.com/vmg/rinku.git

Rinku is a standalone library
-----------------------------

It exports a single method called `Rinku.auto_link`.

~~~~~ruby
require 'rinku'

Rinku.auto_link(text, mode=:all, link_attr=nil, skip_tags=nil)
Rinku.auto_link(text, mode=:all, link_attr=nil, skip_tags=nil) { |link_text| ... }
~~~~~~

Parses a block of text looking for "safe" urls or email addresses,
and turns them into HTML links with the given attributes.

NOTE: The block of text may or may not be HTML; if the text is HTML,
Rinku will skip the relevant tags to prevent double-linking and linking
inside `pre` blocks by default.

NOTE: If the input text is HTML, it's expected to be already escaped.
Rinku will perform no escaping.

NOTE: Currently the follow protocols are considered safe and are the
only ones that will be autolinked.

    http:// https:// ftp:// mailto://

Email addresses are also autolinked by default. URLs without a protocol
specifier but starting with 'www.' will also be autolinked, defaulting to
the 'http://' protocol.

-   `text` is a string in plain text or HTML markup. If the string is formatted in
HTML, Rinku is smart enough to skip the links that are already enclosed in `<a>`
tags.`

-   `mode` is a symbol, either `:all`, `:urls` or `:email_addresses`, 
which specifies which kind of links will be auto-linked. 

-   `link_attr` is a string containing the link attributes for each link that
will be generated. These attributes are not sanitized and will be include as-is
in each generated link, e.g.

     ~~~~~ruby
     auto_link('http://www.pokemon.com', :all, 'target="_blank"')
     # => '<a href="http://www.pokemon.com" target="_blank">http://www.pokemon.com</a>'
     ~~~~~

    This string can be autogenerated from a hash using the Rails `tag_options` helper.

-   `skip_tags` is a list of strings with the names of HTML tags that will be skipped
when autolinking. If `nil`, this defaults to the value of the global `Rinku.skip_tags`,
which is initially `["a", "pre", "code", "kbd", "script"]`.

-   `&block` is an optional block argument. If a block is passed, it will
be yielded for each found link in the text, and its return value will be used instead
of the name of the link. E.g.

    ~~~~~ruby
    auto_link('Check it out at http://www.pokemon.com') do |url|
      "THE POKEMAN WEBSITEZ"
    end
    # => 'Check it out at <a href="http://www.pokemon.com">THE POKEMAN WEBSITEZ</a>'
    ~~~~~~

Rinku is a drop-in replacement for Rails 3.1 `auto_link`
----------------------------------------------------

Auto-linking functionality has been removed from Rails 3.1,
and is instead offered as a standalone gem, `rails_autolink`. You can
choose to use Rinku instead.

~~~~ruby
require 'rails_rinku'
include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper
post_body = "Welcome to my new blog at http://www.myblog.com/."
auto_link(post_body, :html => { :target => '_blank' }) do |text|
  truncate(text, :length => 15)
end
# => "Welcome to my new blog at <a href=\"http://www.myblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.m...</a>."
~~~~

The `rails_rinku` package monkeypatches Rails with an `auto_link` method that
mimics 100% the original one, parameter per parameter. It's just faster.

Developing
----------
```
$ gem install rake-compiler

$ rake
```
