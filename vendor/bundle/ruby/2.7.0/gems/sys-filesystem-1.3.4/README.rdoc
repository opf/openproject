== Description
A cross platform Ruby interface for getting file system information.

== Installation
  gem install sys-filesystem

== Synopsis
  require 'sys/filesystem'
  include Sys
   
  # Display information about a particular filesystem.
  p Filesystem.stat('/')

  # Sample output

  #<Sys::Filesystem::Stat:0x517440
    @base_type = "ufs",
    @flags = 4,
    @files_available = 3817457,
    @block_size = 8192,
    @blocks_available = 19957633,
    @blocks = 34349612,
    @name_max = 255,
    @path = "/",
    @filesystem_id = 35651592,
    @files = 4135040,
    @fragment_size = 1024,
    @files_free = 3817457,
    @blocks_free = 20301129
  >
   
  # Describe all mount points on the system
  Filesystem.mounts{ |mount| p mount }
   
  # Find the mount point of any particular file
  puts Filesystem.mount_point('/home/djberge/some_file.txt') => '/home'

== Notes
This is a pure Ruby implementation that uses FFI. This means it should work
with JRuby, too.

== Sample code
Run 'rake example' if you want to see a basic sample run. The actual code
is 'example_stat.rb' in the 'examples' directory. Modify it as you see fit.

== Known Bugs
None that I'm aware of. Please report bugs on the project page at:

  https://github.com/djberg96/sys-filesystem

== Future Plans

* Add better 64-bit support for Linux and BSD.
* Other suggestions welcome.

== Acknowledgements
Mike Hall, for ideas and code that I borrowed from his 'filesystem' library.

Park Heesob, for implementation and API ideas for the MS Windows version.

Nobuyoshi Miyokawa, for adding the original FreeBSD and OS X support.
