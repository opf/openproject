* Implemented vertical waterfall charts.  Can create waterfall plot as
  option to bar chart.  See examples folder of distribution.
* Enhanced plot labels for waterfall style.
* Enhanced bar plots so you can now color each bar of a series 
  independently with the "varyBarColor" option.
* Refactored series drawing so that each series and series shadow drawn
  on it's own canvas.  Allows series to be redrawn independently of eachother.
* Added additional default series colors.

  only seriesColors array to define all bar/filled line colors.
* Fix css for cursor legend.

* Refactored date methods out of dateAxisRenderer so that date formatter 
  and methods can be accesses outside of dateAxisRenderer plugin.
* Fixed #132, now trigger series change event on plot target instead of drag canvas.
* Fixes issue #116 where some source files had mix of tabs and spaces 
  for indentation.  Should have been all spaces.
* Fixed issue #126, some links broken in docs section of web site.
* Fixed issue #90, trendline plugin incompatibility with pie renderer.
* Updated samples in examples folder of distribution to include navigation 
  links if web server is set up to process .html files with php.


0.9.6:

* New, easier to use, replot() method for placing plots in tabs, accordions,
  resizable containers or for changing plot parameters programmatically.
* Updated legend renderer for pie charts to draw swatches which will
  print correctly.
* Fixed issue #118 with patch from taum so autoscale option will
  honor tickInterval and numberTicks options
* Fix to plot diameter calculation for initially hidden plots.
* Added examples for making plots in jQuery UI tabs and accordions.
* Fixed issue #120 where pie chart with single slice not displaying
  correctly in IE and Chrome

* Fixed #102 where double clicking on plot that has zoom enabled, but
  has not been zoomed resulted in error.

* Added option to turn individual series labels off in the legend.


0.9.5.1:

* Fixed bug where tooltip not working with OHLC and candlestick charts.
* Added additional marker styles: plus, X and dash.


0.9.5:

* Implemented "zoomProxy".  zoomProxy allows zooming one plot from another 
  such as an overview plot.
* Zooming can now be constrained to just x or y axis.
* Enhanced cursor plugin with vertical "dataTracking" line.  This is a line
  at the cursor location with a readout of data points at the line location
  which are displayed in the chart legend.
* Changed cursor tooltip format string.  Now one format string is used for
  entire tooptip.
* Added mechanisms to specify plot size when plot target is hidden or plot
  height/width otherwise cannot be determined from markup.
* Added $.jqplot.config object to specify jqplot wide configuraiton options.
  These include enablePlugins to globally set the default plugin state on/off
  and defaultHeight/defaultWidth to specify default plot height/width.
* Added fillToZero option which forces filled charts to fill to zero as opposed
  to axis minimum.  Thus negative filled bar/line values will fill upwards to
  zero axis value.
* Added option to disable stacking on individual lines.
* Changed targetId property of the plot object so it now includes a "#" before
  the id string.
* Improved tick and body sizing of Open Hi Low Close and candlestick charts.
* Removed lots of web site related files from the repository.  This means that,
  if working from the sources, user's won't be able to build the jqplot web
  site and the docs/tests that are hosted on that site.  The minified and
  compressed  distribution packages will build fine.
* Lots of examples were added to a separate examples directory to better show
  functionality of jqPlot for local testing with the distribution.
* Many various bug fixes and other minor enhancements.


0.9.4:

* Implemented axis labels.  Labels can be rendered in div tags or as canvas

  elements.

* Fixed undesirable behavior where point labels for points off the plot
  were being rendered.
* Added edgeTolerance option to point label renderer to control rendering of 
  labels near plot edges.


0.9.3:

* Preliminary support for axis labels.  Currently rendered into DIV tags,
  so no ratated label support.  This feature is currently expreimental.
* Fixed bug #52, needed space in tick div tag between style and class declarations 
  or plot failed in certain application doctypes.
