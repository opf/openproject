    You're looking at the current **stable** documentation of the OpenProject APIv3. If you're interested in the current
    development version, please go to [github.com/opf](https://github.com/opf/openproject/tree/dev/docs/api/apiv3).

    ## Introduction

    The documentation for the APIv3 is written according to the [OpenAPI 3.0 Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).
    You can either view the static version of this documentation on the [website](https://www.openproject.com/docs/api/introduction/)
    or the interactive Swagger UI version in your OpenProject installation under `/api/docs`.
    In the latter you can try out the various API endpoints directly interacting with our OpenProject data.
    Moreover you can access the specification source itself under `/api/v3/spec.json` and `/api/v3/spec.yml`
    (e.g. [here](https://community.openproject.org/api/v3/spec.yml)).

    The APIv3 is a hypermedia REST API, a shorthand for "Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State" (HATEOAS).
    This means that each endpoint of this API will have links to other resources or actions defined in the resulting body.

    These related resources and actions for any given resource will be context sensitive. For example, only actions that the
    authenticated user can take are being rendered. This can be used to dynamically identify actions that the user might take for any
    given response.

    As an example, if you fetch a work package through the [Work Package endpoint](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/work-packages/), the `update` link will only
    be present when the user you authenticated has been granted a permission to update the work package in the assigned project.

    ## HAL+JSON

    HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API.
    Read more in the following specification: [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08)

    **OpenProject API implementation of HAL+JSON format** enriches JSON and introduces a few meta properties:

    - `_type` - specifies the type of the resource (e.g.: WorkPackage, Project)
    - `_links` - contains all related resource and action links available for the resource
    - `_embedded` - contains all embedded objects

    HAL does not guarantee that embedded resources are embedded in their full representation, they might as well be
    partially represented (e.g. some properties can be left out).
    However in this API you have the guarantee that whenever a resource is **embedded**, it is embedded in its **full representation**.

    ## API response structure

    All API responses contain a single HAL+JSON object, even collections of objects are technically represented by
    a single HAL+JSON object that itself contains its members. More details on collections can be found
    in the [Collections Section](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/group-objects/).

    ## Authentication

    The API supports the following authentication schemes: OAuth2, session based authentication, and basic auth.

    Depending on the settings of the OpenProject instance many resources can be accessed without being authenticated.
    In case the instance requires authentication on all requests the client will receive an **HTTP 401** status code
    in response to any request.

    Otherwise unauthenticated clients have all the permissions of the anonymous user.

    ### Session-based Authentication

    This means you have to login to OpenProject via the Web-Interface to be authenticated in the API.
    This method is well-suited for clients acting within the browser, like the Angular-Client built into OpenProject.

    In this case, you always need to pass the HTTP header `X-Requested-With "XMLHttpRequest"` for authentication.

    ### API Key through Basic Auth

    Users can authenticate towards the API v3 using basic auth with `apikey` (as a string, NOT your API key) as the user name and their API key as the password.
    Users can find their API key on their account page.

    Example:

    ```bash
    API_KEY=2519132cdf62dcf5a66fd96394672079f9e9cad1
    curl -u apikey:$API_KEY https://community.openproject.com/api/v3/users/42
    ```

    ### OAuth2.0 authentication

    OpenProject allows authentication and authorization with OAuth2 with *Authorization code flow*, as well as *Client credentials* operation modes.

    To get started, you first need to register an application in the OpenProject OAuth administration section of your installation.
    This will save an entry for your application with a client unique identifier (`client_id`) and an accompanying secret key (`client_secret`).

    You can then use one the following guides to perform the supported OAuth 2.0 flows:

    - [Authorization code flow](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code)

    - [Authorization code flow with PKCE](https://doorkeeper.gitbook.io/guides/ruby-on-rails/pkce-flow), recommended for clients unable to keep the client_secret confidential.

    - [Client credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/) - Requires an application to be bound to an impersonating user for non-public access

    ### Why not username and password?

    The simplest way to do basic auth would be to use a user's username and password naturally.
    However, OpenProject already has supported API keys in the past for the API v2, though not through basic auth.

    Using **username and password** directly would have some advantages:

    * It is intuitive for the user who then just has to provide those just as they would when logging into OpenProject.

    * No extra logic for token management necessary.

    On the other hand using **API keys** has some advantages too, which is why we went for that:

    * If compromised while saved on an insecure client the user only has to regenerate the API key instead of changing their password, too.

    * They are naturally long and random which makes them invulnerable to dictionary attacks and harder to crack in general.

    Most importantly users may not actually have a password to begin with. Specifically when they have registered
    through an OpenID Connect provider.

    ## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

    By default, the OpenProject API is _not_ responding with any CORS headers.
    If you want to allow cross-domain AJAX calls against your OpenProject instance, you need to enable CORS headers being returned.

    Please see [our API settings documentation](https://www.openproject.org/docs/system-admin-guide/system-settings/api-settings/) on
    how to selectively enable CORS.

    ## Allowed HTTP methods

    - `GET` - Get a single resource or collection of resources

    - `POST` - Create a new resource or perform

    - `PATCH` - Update a resource

    - `DELETE` - Delete a resource

    ## Compression

    Responses are compressed if requested by the client. Currently [gzip](https://www.gzip.org/) and [deflate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951)
    are supported. The client signals the desired compression by setting the [`Accept-Encoding` header](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.3).
    If no `Accept-Encoding` header is send, `Accept-Encoding: identity` is assumed which will result in the API responding uncompressed.

        Clients can create attachments without a container first and attach them later on.
        This is useful if the container does not exist at the time the attachment is uploaded.
        After the upload, the client can then claim such containerless attachments for any resource eligible (e.g. WorkPackage) on subsequent requests.
        The upload and the claiming *must* be done for the same user account. Attachments uploaded by another user cannot be claimed and
        once claimed for a resource, they cannot be claimed by another.

        The upload request must be of type `multipart/form-data` with exactly two parts.

        The first part *must* be called `metadata`. Its content type is expected to be `application/json`,
        the body *must* be a single JSON object, containing at least the `fileName` and optionally the attachments `description`.

        The second part *must* be called `file`, its content type *should* match the mime type of the file.
        The body *must* be the raw content of the file.
        Note that a `filename` *must* be indicated in the `Content-Disposition` of this part, although it will be ignored.
        Instead the `fileName` inside the JSON of the metadata part will be used.

          JSON specifying filter conditions.
          Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/queries/) endpoint.
          Currently supported filters are:

          + any_name_attribute: filters memberships based on the name of the principal. All possible name variants (and also email and login) are searched.

          + blocked: reduces the result set to all memberships that are temporarily blocked or that are not blocked temporarily.

          + group: filters memberships based on the name of a group. The group however is not the principal used for filtering. Rather, the memberships of the group are used as the filter values.

          + name: filters memberships based on the name of the principal. Note that only the name is used which depends on a setting in the OpenProject instance.

          + principal: filters memberships based on the id of the principal.

          + project: filters memberships based on the id of the project.

          + role: filters memberships based on the id of any role assigned to the membership.

          + status: filters memberships based on the status of the principal.

          + created_at: filters memberships based on the time the membership was created.

          + updated_at: filters memberships based on the time the membership was updated last.

          + status: Sort by the status of the principal. Groups and principal users, which do not have a status, are sorted together with the active users.

          Currently supported filters are:

          + active: based on the active property of the project

          + ancestor: filters projects by their ancestor. A project is not considered to be it's own ancestor.

          + created_at: based on the time the project was created

          + latest_activity_at: based on the time the last activity was registered on a project.

          + name_and_identifier: based on both the name and the identifier.

          + parent_id: filters projects by their parent.

          + principal: based on members of the project.

          + type_id: based on the types active in a project.

          + user_action: based on the actions the current user has in the project.

          + id: based on projects' id.

          + visible: based on the visibility for the user (id) provided as the filter value. This filter is useful for admins to identify the projects visible to a user.
          There might also be additional filters based on the custom fields that have been configured.

        Lists projects which can become parent to another project. Only sound candidates are returned.
        For instance a project cannot become parent of itself or it's children.

        To specify the project for which a parent is queried for, the `of` parameter can be provided. If no `of`
        parameter is provided, a new project is assumed. Then, the check for the hierarchy is omitted as a new project cannot be
        part of a hierarchy yet.

        Candidates can be filtered. Most commonly one will want to filter by name or identifier.
        You can do this through the `filters` parameter which works just like the work package index.

        For instance to find all parent candidates with "rollout" in their name:

        ```
        ?filters=[{"name_and_identifier":{"operator":"~","values":["rollout"]}}]
        ```

        When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing the properties and links that it wants to change, in the body.
        It is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the **write** operation.

        Note that changing the `type` of a relation invariably also changes the respective `reverseType` as well as the "name" of it.
        The returned Relation object will reflect that change. For instance if you change a Relation's
        `type` to "follows" then the `reverseType` will be changed to `precedes`.

        Creates a new user. Only administrators and users with manage_user global permission are allowed to do so.
        When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing at least the properties and links that are required, in the body.

        Valid values for `status`:

        1) "active" - In this case a password has to be provided in addition to the other attributes.

        2) "invited" - In this case nothing but the email address is required. The rest is optional. An invitation will be sent to the user.

        When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing at least the properties and links that are required, in the body.
        The required fields of a View can be found in its schema, which is embedded in the respective form.
        Note that it is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the write operation.

        There are different subtypes of `Views` (e.g. `Views::WorkPackagesTable`) with each having its own
        endpoint for creating that subtype e.g.

        * `/api/v3/views/work_packages_table` for `Views::WorkPackagesTable`
        * `/api/v3/views/team_planner` for `Views::TeamPlanner`
        * `/api/v3/views/work_packages_calendar` for `Views::WorkPackagesCalendar`

        **Not yet implemented** To get the list of available subtypes and by that the endpoints for creating a subtype, use the
        ```
          /api/v3/views/schemas

        When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing the properties and links that it wants to change, in the body.
        Note that it is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the **write** operation.

        Additionally to the fields the client wants to change, it is mandatory to provide the value of `lockVersion` which was received
        by the `GET` request this change originates from.

        The value of `lockVersion` is used to implement [optimistic locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control).

      description: |-
        To add an attachment to a work package, a client needs to issue a request of type `multipart/form-data`
        with exactly two parts.

        The first part *must* be called `metadata`. Its content type is expected to be `application/json`,
        the body *must* be a single JSON object, containing at least the `fileName` and optionally the attachments `description`.

        The second part *must* be called `file`, its content type *should* match the mime type of the file.
        The body *must* be the raw content of the file.
        Note that a `filename` must be indicated in the `Content-Disposition` of this part, however it will be ignored.
        Instead the `fileName` inside the JSON of the metadata part will be used.

        Creates file links on a work package.

        The request body must contain the generated storage token, and not the storage id. In addition, the request must
        send the origin file id and the stored meta data.

        If there is already a link on the given work package with the same file id from the same storage, the previous
        data is not overwritten.

        As it is possible to link folders from a storage to a work package, the _mimeType_ of this entity can be empty.

- description: "## Links\n\nLinks to other resources in the API are represented uniformly
    by so called link objects.\n\n### Local Properties\n\n| Property  | Description
    \                                                             | Type    | Required
    | Nullable | Default     |\n|:---------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | ------- |:--------:|:--------:| ----------- |\n| href      | URL to the referenced
    resource (might be relative)                       | String  |    ✓     |    ✓
    \    |             |\n| title     | Representative label for the resource                                    |
    String  |          |          |             |\n| templated | If true the `href`
    contains parts that need to be replaced by the client | Boolean |          |          |
    false       |\n| method    | The HTTP verb to use when requesting the resource
    \                       | String  |          |          | GET         |\n| payload
    \  | The payload to send in the request to achieve the desired result         |
    String  |          |          | unspecified |\n| identifier| An optional unique
    identifier to the link object                         | String  |          |          |
    unspecified |\n\nAll link objects *must* contain the `href` property, though it
    might be `null`. Thus the following is a valid\nlink object: `{ \"href\": null
    }`  whereas `{ }` is not a valid link object.\nThe meaning of `\"href\": null`
    is that **no** resource is referenced.\nFor example a work package without an
    assignee will still have an assignee link, but its `href` will be `null`.\n\nIf
    a `title` is present, the client can display the title to the user when referring
    to the resource.\n\nTemplated links are links that contain client replaceable
    parts. Replaceable parts are enclosed in braces. For example\nthe link `api/v3/example/{id}`
    is not complete in itself, but the client needs to replace the string `{id}` itself.\nAs
    of now the API does not indicate the valid replacement values.\n\nThe `method`
    indicates which HTTP verb the client *must* use when following the link for the
    intended purpose.\n\nIf a `payload` is specified, it needs to be sent as the body
    of the request to achieve the desired result (e.g. perform the\naction represented
    by the link). If no `payload` is specified, there is either no payload to send
    or a valid payload is not specified\nby the link object. A payload might also
    be templated slightly. If the `templated` property is true, a payload might contain
    replaceable parts\nin its strings (e.g. `{ \"href\": \"/api/v3/examples/{example_id}\"
    }`).\n\nNote: When writing links (e.g. during a `PATCH` operation) only changes
    to `href` are accepted.\nChanges to all other properties will be **silently ignored**.\n\nFor
    resources invisible to the client (e.g. because of missing permissions), a link
    will contain\nthe uri `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:undisclosed` instead of a url.
    This indicates the existence of a value\nwithout revealing the actual value. An
    example for this is the parent project. A project resource which itself might
    be\nvisible to the client can have a reference to a parent project invisible to
    the same client. Revealing the existence of\na parent over hiding has the benefit
    of allowing the client to make an informed decision of whether to keep the existing
    reference\nor updating it. Sending ‘{ \"href\": \"urn:openproject-org:api:v3:undisclosed\"
    }` for a resource will have the effect of keeping the\noriginal value. This is
    especially beneficial if the client creates and updates resources based on the
    payload object provided\nas part of a form as is recommended when interacting
    with the API.\n\n## Errors\n\nIn case of an error, the API will respond with an
    appropriate HTTP status code.\nFor responses with an HTTP status of `4xx` and
    `5xx` the body will always contain a single error object.\nError objects shall
    give the client additional details about the cause of an erroneous response.\n\n###
    General errors\n\n* Error objects have their `_type` set to `Error`\n\n* The `errorIdentifier`
    serves as a unique (and machine readable) identifier for a specific error cause\n
    \   * There *may* be multiple possible error identifiers per HTTP status code\n
    \   * There *may* be multiple possible HTTP status codes per error identifier\n
    \   * The \"List of Error Identifiers\" defines the possible mappings between
    HTTP status and error identifier\n\n* The `message` contains a human readable
    concise message describing the error\n    * It *optionally* includes specific
    information, for example which permission would have been needed to perform an
    action\n    * It is localized depending on the users preferences\n    * It *must
    not* include HTML or other kind of markup\n    * Error messages form complete
    sentences including punctuation\n\n##### Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_type\": \"Error\",\n
    \ \"errorIdentifier\": \"urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InternalServerError\",\n
    \ \"message\": \"An internal server error occurred. This is not your fault.\"\n}\n```\n\n###
    Embedded error information\n\nErrors might optionally contain embedded objects
    that contain further information.\n\n#### Error details\n\nUnder the embedded
    key `details` there might be an object describing the error more verbosely. For
    example if the\nerror affects a specific field, this field could be defined there.\n\n#####
    Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_type\": \"Error\",\n  \"errorIdentifier\": \"urn:openproject-org:api:v3:examples:ExampleError\",\n
    \ \"message\": \"This is an example error.\",\n  \"_embedded\": {\n    \"details\":
    {\n      \"_type\": \"ExampleErrorDetailInformation\",\n      \"erroneousField\":
    \"subject\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Multiple error objects\n\nTo ease implementation
    of basic clients it is guaranteed that the response body always only contains
    a single error object.\nHowever it is allowed that an error object *embeds* other
    error objects under the key `errors`, thereby aggregating them.\n\nThe `errorIdentifier`
    of such an object is always `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MultipleErrors`.
    The message can either describe one of the\nembedded errors or simply state that
    multiple errors occurred.\n\n##### Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_type\": \"Error\",\n
    \ \"errorIdentifier\": \"urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MultipleErrors\",\n
    \ \"message\": \"Multiple fields violated their constraints.\",\n  \"_embedded\":
    {\n    \"errors\": [\n      {\n        \"_type\": \"Error\",\n        \"errorIdentifier\":
    \"urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation\",\n        \"...\":
    \"...\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"_type\": \"Error\",\n        \"errorIdentifier\":
    \"urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation\",\n        \"...\":
    \"...\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### List of Error Identifiers\n\n* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidQuery`
    (**HTTP 400**)  \nThe query contained a value that did not match the servers expectation\n\n*
    `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRequestBody` (**HTTP 400**)  \nThe format
    of the request body did not match the servers expectation\n\n* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRenderContext`
    (**HTTP 400**)  \nThe client specified a rendering context that does not exist\n\n*
    `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidUserStatusTransition` (**HTTP 400**)
    \ \nThe client used an invalid transition in the attempt to change the status
    of a user account.\n\n* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:Unauthenticated` (**HTTP
    401**)  \nThe client has to authenticate to access the requested resource.\n\n*
    `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MissingPermission` (**HTTP 403**)  \nThe client
    does not have the needed permissions to perform the requested action\n\n* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:NotFound`
    (**HTTP 404**)  \nDefault for HTTP 404 when no further information is available\n\n*
    `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:UpdateConflict` (**HTTP 409**)  \nThe resource
    changed between GET-ing it and performing an update on it\n\n* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:TypeNotSupported`
    (**HTTP 415**)  \nThe request contained data in an unsupported media type (Content-Type)\n\n*
    `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyIsReadOnly` (**HTTP 422**)  \nThe client
    tried to set or change a property that is not writable\n\n* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation`
    (**HTTP 422**)  \nThe client tried to set a property to an invalid value\n\n*
    `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyValueNotAvailableAnymore` (**HTTP 422**)
    \ \nAn unchanged property needs to be changed, because other changes to the resource
    make it unavailable\n\n* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:ResourceTypeMismatch`
    (**HTTP 422**)  \nA link to a resource of a specific type was expected, but the
    link to another type of resource was provided\n\n* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyFormatError`
    (**HTTP 422**)  \nA property value was provided in a format that the server does
    not understand or accept\n\n* `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InternalServerError`
    (**HTTP 500**)  \nDefault for HTTP 500 when no further information is available\n\n*
    `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MultipleErrors`  \nMultiple errors occurred.
    See the embedded `errors` array for more details.\n\n## Formattable Text\n\nOpenProject
    supports text formatting in Markdown. Properties that contain formattable text
    have a special representation in this API. In this specification their\ntype is
    indicated as `Formattable`. Their representation contains the following properties:\n\n|
    Property | Description                                        | Type   | Example
    \                           | Supported operations |\n|:--------:| --------------------------------------------------
    | ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |\n| format
    \  | Indicates the formatting language of the raw text  | String | markdown                           |
    READ                 |\n| raw      | The raw text, as entered by the user               |
    String | `I **am** formatted!`              | READ / WRITE         |\n| html     |
    The text converted to HTML according to the format | String | `I <strong>am</strong>
    formatted!` | READ                 |\n\n`format` can as of today have one of the
    following values:\n\n* `plain` - only basic formatting, e.g. inserting paragraphs
    and line breaks into HTML\n\n* `markdown` - formatting using Markdown\n\n* `custom`
    - There is no apparent formatting rule that transforms the raw version to HTML
    (only used for read only properties)\n\nNote that `raw` is the only property supporting
    the **write** operation. A property of type *Formattable* that\nis marked as **read
    and write**, will only accept changes to the `raw` property. Changes to `format`
    and `html` will be **silently ignored**.\nIt is thus sufficient to solely provide
    the `raw` property for changes.\n\nIf the *Formattable* is marked as **read only**,
    the `raw` attribute also becomes **read only**.\n\n##### Example\n\n```json\n{\n
    \ \"format\": \"markdown\",\n  \"raw\": \"I **am** formatted!\",\n  \"html\":
    \"I <strong>am</strong> formatted!\"\n}\n```\n\n## Dates, Times and Durations\n\nRepresentation
    of time related values in this API is done according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).\nIn
    this specification the following terms will be used as type specifiers (e.g. in
    tables):\n\n* `Date` - refers to an ISO 8601 date, e.g. \"2014-05-21\"\n\n* `DateTime`
    - refers to an ISO 8601 combined date and time, e.g. \"2014-05-21T13:37:00Z\"\n\n*
    `Duration` - refers to an ISO 8601 duration, e.g. \"P1DT18H\"\n\n## Colors\n\nColors
    are represented in RGB using hexadecimal notation as specified in [CSS Color Module
    Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/).\nThat is a `#` followed by either
    three or six hexadecimal digits.\n\n##### Example\n\n```\n    red:   #ff0000 or
    #f00\n    green: #00ff00 or #0f0\n    black: #000000 or #000\n    white: #ffffff
    or #fff\n```\n\n## Digests\n\nDigests (or Hashes) are one way functions that map
    data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size.\nIn OpenProject they are for example
    used to calculate checksums for (attachment) files.\nThe checksum calculated depends
    on the hashed data and the algorithm used as hash function.\n\nTherefore all digests
    are represented in the following form:\n\n| Property  | Description                                        |
    Type   | Example                            |\n|:---------:| --------------------------------------------------
    | ------ | ---------------------------------- |\n| algorithm | The algorithm used
    to compute the digest           | String | md5                                |\n|
    hash      | The calculated digest in hexadecimal notation      | String | 64c26a8403cd796ea4cf913cda2ee4a9
    \  |\n\n##### Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"algorithm\": \"md5\",\n  \"hash\": \"64c26a8403cd796ea4cf913cda2ee4a9\"\n}\n```"

    Whenever a client calls a resource that can return more than one element, it will receive a collection of elements.
    However as collections can become quite large, the API will **not** simply return a JSON array, but a special collection
    object that will contain the actual elements in its embedded property `elements`.

    Collections *may* be paginated, this means that a single response from the server will not contain all elements of the collection,
    but only a subset. In this case the client can issue further requests to retrieve the remaining elements.
    There are two ways to access the result pages of a paginated collection:

    * offset based pagination

    * cursor based pagination

    The available ways of pagination depend on the collection queried. Some collections feature no pagination at all, meaning they
    will always return all elements. Others might only offer one of the two pagination methods or both of them.

    A collection also carries meta information like the total count of elements in the collection or - in case of a paginated collection -
    the amount of elements returned in this response and action links to retrieve the remaining elements.

    Filter objects can be added to a number of endpoints in the OpenProject APIv3. With them, you can create powerful queries to endpoints to return the data that you want.

    They all share the following basic properties:

    - They consist of three items: A property to filter or a specific filter name, one or more values, and a filter operator that defines what query to produce with the given values

    - You can combine any number of distinct filters can be added to the endpoint definitions in this API documentation

    - A combination of filter objects are treated as an AND filter. OR filters are not yet possible in a single query.

    ## Filter syntax

    The filter syntax is a JSON object that can be passed as a GET parameter to the endpoints as an URL-encoded JSON string looks like the following:

    ```json
    [
      { "<filter name>": { "operator": "<operator>", "values": [<value>, ...] },
      ...
    ]
    ```

    **Example**

    Filtering the work packages API endpoint for a work package that matches the subject or ID "12" and has a status with the ID=5.

    ```json
    [
      { "subjectOrId": { "operator": "**", values: ["12"] } },
      { "status": { "operator": "=", values: ["5"] } }
    ]
    ```

    With the above JSON stringified and URL-encoded, this can be added to the `/api/v3/work_packages` endpoint using the `filter` parameter to form the URL:

    ```
    https://community.openproject.com/api/v3/work_packages?filters=%5B%7B%22subjectOrId%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22**%22,%22values%22:%5B%2212%22%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22status%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22=%22,%22values%22:%5B%225%22%5D%7D%7D%5D
    ```

    ## Compression

    As the above can become quite long, especially if a lot of filter values are included, the API offers to wrap all query props into a zlib compressed and base64 encoded property (`eprops`).
    The property will then not only include the filter but the complete query props set (e.g. `pageSize`, `offset` and `columns`. So `eprops` is then a JSON object that is compressed and encoded.

    **Example**

    Instead of the request

    ```
    https://community.openproject.com/api/v3/work_packages?filters=[%7B%22subjectOrId%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22**%22,%22values%22:[%2212%22]%7D%7D,%7B%22status%22:%7B%22operator%22:%22=%22,%22values%22:[%225%22]%7D%7D]&pageSize=10&sortBy=[[%22id%22,%20%22asc%22]]
    ```

    Which in a non URL encoded style would be

    ```
    https://community.openproject.com/api/v3/work_packages?filters=[{"subjectOrId":{"operator":"**","values":["12"]}},{"status":{"operator":"=","values":["5"]}}]&pageSize=10&sortBy=[["id", "asc"]]
    ```

    All of the props can be put inside a json object

    ```json
    {
      "filters": "[{\"subjectOrId\":{\"operator\":\"**\",\"values\":[\"12\"]}},{\"status\":{\"operator\":\"=\",\"values\":[\"5\"]}}]",
      "sortBy": "[[\"id\",\"asc\"]]",
      "pageSize": 10
    }
    ```

    Please note, that all objects that have to be json (e.g `filters`) will be double encoded.

    That json object can then be compressed and encoded and the result sent over as the combined `eprops` parameter:

    ```
    https://community.openproject.com/api/v3/work_packages?eprops=eJxtjTELwjAUhP%2FLjSWDFVwCLt2cHBz7OsT2VSKFlLwXQUv%2Bu0lXHe%2B7%2B7gN%0As1%2BUo8Ci3wiS7k8e9RovE8EWEFaOTkMsidA0BEN4uSWxFNIT2iNhyNlUV50m%0A%2BaOdf6zTLg0wkBC1e9f3gv20L52Mpa%2Ft6h588x%2BGbQ%2F5C12YN%2BM%3D%0A
    ```

    ## Available filters

    The availability of filters depend on the endpoint you're querying and will be listed in each endpoint definition. For work packages, you can also [start using filters in the work packages module](https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages) to build your query and then simply copy the URL from your browser to get the resulting filter values and their operators.

    ## Available operators

    The following table is a list of all available operators. Not all endpoints and parameters support all values, but this list serves as a lookup table for identifying and using the operators. When building a filter object, you use the **symbol** listed below.

    | Symbol | Description of filtered properties                           | Values array contains      |
    | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |

    | `!`    | are not equal one of the given value(s)                      | At least one typed value   |
    | `>=`   | are greater or equal than the given value                    | One numerical value        |
    | `<=`   | are lesser or equal than the given value                     | One numerical value        |
    | `t-`   | are the given number of days in the past                     | 1 integer (days)           |

    | `>t+`  | are *more than* the given number of days in the future       | 1 integer (days)           |
    | `>t-`  | are *less than* the given number of days in the past         | 1 integer (days)           |
    | `<t-`  | are *more than* the given number of days in the past         | 1 integer (days)           |
    | `*`    | are not NULL                                                 | *nothing, values is empty* |
    | `!*`   | are NULL                                                     | *nothing, values is empty* |
    | `**`   | searches the given string in all string-based attributes     | One string value           |
    | `=d`   | are on the given date                                        | 1 ISO8601 date/datetime    |
    | `<>d`  | are between the two given dates.                             | 2 ISO8601 date/datetimes   |
    | `w`    | are in this week                                             | *nothing, values is empty* |
    | `t`    | are today                                                    | *nothing, values is empty* |
    | `~`    | are containing the given words (SQL LIKE) in that order      | At least one string value  |
    | `!~`   | are *not* containing the given words (SQL LIKE) in that order | At least one string value  |

    ​

    **Special operators for work packages**

    There are some additional operators only in use for work packages:

    | Symbol | Description of filtered properties         | Values array contains      |
    | ------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
    | `o`    | the status of the work package is *open*   | *nothing, values is empty* |
    | `c`    | the status of the work package is *closed* | *nothing, values is empty* |
    | `ow`   | the work packages have a manual sort order | *nothing, values is empty* |

    There are also relation filters for work packages that have the symbols `blocks/blocked` `children/parent` `follows/precedes` `duplicates/duplicated` `partof/includes` `relates` `requires/required` depending on the direction of the relation and take as value the work package ID that is the target node of the relation.

    This API provides forms as a concept to aid in editing or creating resources. The goal of forms is to:

    * make writable properties of a resource discoverable

    * show to which values a property can be set

    * validate changes to a resource and indicate validation errors

    These benefits aside, a client can freely choose to immediately edit a resource without prior validation by a form.
    In the case of an invalid request the edit will fail and return appropriate errors nevertheless.

    A form is associated to a single resource and aids in performing changes on that resource.
    When posting to a form endpoint with an empty request body or an empty JSON object,
    you will receive an initial form for the associated resource.
    Subsequent calls to the form should contain a single JSON object as described by the form.

    ## Actions

    | Link                | Description                                                           | Condition                        |

    ## Linked Properties

    | Link                | Description                                      | Type          | Nullable | Supported operations |
    |:-------------------:| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
    | self                | This form                                        | Form          |          | READ                 |

    ## Embedded Properties:

    Apart from the linked properties, forms contain always three other embedded properties:

    * `payload`

    * `schema`

    * `validationErrors`

    Their purpose is explained below.

    ### Payload

    The payload contains an edited version of the resource that will be modified when committing the form.
    This representation contains all writable properties of the resource and reflects all changes that the latest call to **validate** included,
    thereby acting as a preview for the changes.

    In case the client tries to set the value to something invalid, the invalid change is also reflected here. However a validation error (see below)
    indicates that a commit of this payload would fail.

    It might happen that setting one property affects the allowed values for another property. Thus by changing a property A
    the current value of another property B might become invalid. If the client did not yet touch the value of B, the payload will
    contain a default value for that property. Nevertheless the client will also receive an appropriate validation error for value B.

    The content of this element *can* be used as a template for the request body of a call to **validate** or **commit**.

    A call to **validate** and **commit** does not need to include all properties that were defined in the `payload` section.
    It is only necessary to include the properties that you want to change, as well as the `lockVersion` if one is present.
    However you *may* include all the properties sent in the `payload` section.

    ### Schema

    The schema embedded in a form is a normal [schema describing the underlying resource](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/schemas/).
    However, the embedded schema can change with each revalidation of the form.
    For example it might be possible, that changing the type of a work package affects its available properties,
    as well as possible values for certain properties.
    As this makes the embedded schema very dynamic, it is not included as a static link.

    ### Validation Errors

    Like a schema the validation errors build a dictionary where the key is a property name.
    Each value is an error object that indicates the error that occurred validating the corresponding property.
    There are only key value pairs for properties that failed validation, the element is empty if all validations succeeded.

    However note that even in the case of validation errors, the response you receive from the form endpoint will be an HTTP 200.
    That is because the main purpose of a form is helping the client to sort out validation errors.

    ### Meta object

    Form resources may have an additional `_meta` object that contains parameters to be sent together with the resource,
    but that do not belong to the resource itself. For example, parameters on if and how to send notifications for the action
    performed with the API request can be sent.

    Each individual endpoint will describe their meta properties, if available.

- description: |-
    An action is a change one can trigger within the OpenProject instance.
    This could be creating a work package, exporting work packages or updating a user.
    An action can also be something where the user is able to be involved so where the user is in the passive role
    e.g. when being assigned a work package.

    A capability combines an action with a context and a principal. It thus communicates, which principal can carry out
    (or be passively involved) which action within a certain context. E.g. a user might have the capability of creating work packages
    within a project.

    In other words, an action is independent of a principal and context while a capability is
    a relation between an action, the context and the principal.

    The actions are most of the time derived from permissions which can be configured via the administrative UI where an administrator
    selects from a set of permissions to be granted per role. But there are other cases, e.g. in order to become assignee or responsible of a work package, a user has
    to have a role which allows having work packages assigned which is not a permission.

    Even though user might have a capability, it might still not be possible to carry out the action
    because some other requirement is not met.
    E.g. a user might have the capability to update work packages, but if a particular work package is
    in a readonly state, that work package cannot be updated.

    *Only a small set of actions that actually already exist in the system are currently exposed via
    the api. They will be added over time.*

    ## Action

    An action describes what can be carried out within the application. Until an action becomes assigned,
    which turns it into a capability, it remains in the state of "could be".

    | modules     | Clusters the actions into groups into which they belong logically *Not yet implemented* | []String    | Not null       | READ                 |

    ## Capabilities

    Actions can be assigned to a principal by assigning roles to that principal. E.g. a user might receive the 'work_packages/show'
    action by having a role called reader assigned within a project.

    Whenever a principal is assigned an action within a context, the principal has additional capabilities.

    Exactly which actions can be gained by having a role assigned depends on the configuration of that role.
    The configuration is adaptable by admins within the administration of the OpenProject instance.

    The configuration endpoint allows to read certain configuration parameters of the OpenProject instance.
    Note that there is no 1:1 relationship between this endpoint and the settings you can find in your settings.yml.

    For now this endpoint will only allow access to settings deemed useful for a client to know in general.

    As clients might rely on the combination of both, the system settings as well as the current user's preferences, the resource
    embeds the current user's preferences so client can fetch both with one request.

    A grid is a layout for a page or a part of the page of the OpenProject application. It defines the structure (number of rows and number of columns) as well as the contents of the page.

    The contents is defined by `GridWidget`s. While a `GridWidget` is it's own type, it is not a resource in it's own right as it is an intrinsic part of a `Grid`.

    Depending on what page a grid is defined for, different widgets may be eligible to be placed on the grid. The page might also define the permissions needed for accessing, creating or modifying the grid.

    Currently, the following pages employ grids:

    + /my/page: The my page every user has. Only a user can access or modify their "my page".

    *The delete action is not yet supported*

    Groups are collections of users. They support assigning/unassigning multiple users to/from a project in one operation.

    This resource does not yet have the form and schema endpoints. But as all properties are static, clients should still be able
    to work with this resource.

    Users and groups can become members of a project. Such a membership will also have one or more roles assigned to it. By that, memberships control the permissions a user has within a project.

    There are also memberships that do not govern the permissions within a certain project but rather govern global permissions. Among the permissions that can be granted like this are the permissions to "Create project" and "Manage users". Those memberships do not have a project associated.

    When creating and updating memberships, a custom message can be sent to users of new and updated memberships. This message can be provided within the `_meta` group.

    Projects are containers structuring the information (e.g. work packages, wikis) into smaller groups. They can be used in a classic project management approach but also when structuring work by departments.

    As containers, they also control behaviour of the elements within them. One of the most important aspects of this is that projects limit permissions by having members with a certain permission set (roles) assigned to them.

    Depending on custom fields defined for projects, additional links might exist.

    Note, that the parent and ancestor links may contain the "undisclosed uri" `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:undisclosed` in case an
    ancestor project is defined but the client lacks permission to see it. See the

    query that is not assigned to a project (`\"project\": null`) is called a global
    query. Global queries filter work packages regardless of the project they are
    assigned to. As such, a different set of filters exists for those queries.\n\nThe
    `hidden` property is deprecated as it is replaced by the `Views` concept. A query
    that isn't hidden will have a `View` while a query that is hidden won't.\n\nThe
    `timelineVisible`, `timelineLabels`, `timelineZoomLevel`, `highlightingMode` and
    `showHierarchies` properties will be moved into the more appropriate Views (probably
    `Views::WorkPackagesTable`) so it is deprecated to have them within the Query
    directly.\n\n## Query Filter Instance\n\nA QueryFilterInstance defines a filtering
    applied to the list of work packages. As such it contains:\n\n* the filter type
    (`QueryFilter`) used\n\n* the operator (`QueryOperator`) used\n\n* the list of
    values\n\nThe list of values can either consist of a list of links or of a list
    of strings. If the values are primitive (e.g. Integer, Boolean, Date) they will
    be displayed as strings and the QueryFilterInstance will have a `values` property.\n\n```json\n
    \ {\n    \"_type\": \"DueDateQueryFilter\",\n    \"name\": \"Finish date\",\n
    \   \"values\": [\n      \"1\"\n    ],\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n
    \       \"href\": \"/api/v3/queries/filters/dueDate\",\n        \"title\": \"Finish

    \"/api/v3/queries/filter_instance_schemas/dueDate\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nIf
    the values are nonprimitive (e.g. User, Project), they will be listed as objects
    and the QueryFilterInstance will have a `values` link.\n\n```json\n  {\n    \"_type\":
    \"AssigneeQueryFilter\",\n    \"name\": \"Assignee\",\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"filter\":
    {\n        \"href\": \"/api/v3/queries/filters/assignee\",\n        \"title\":

    \         \"title\": \"OpenProject Admin\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n"

    A QueryColumn can be referenced by a Query to denote the work package properties the client should display for the work packages returned as query results. The columns maps to the WorkPackage by the id property. QueryColumns exist in three types: `QueryColumn::Property`, `QueryColumn::RelationToType` and `QueryColumn::RelationOfType`.

    A QueryFilterInstanceSchema is a Schema specifically for describing QueryFilterInstances. Because the behaviour of FilterInstances, with regards to the `values` property, differs from one another depending on the chosen Filter, the QueryFilterInstanceSchema explicitly lists the dependencies in its `_dependencies` property. As the property causing the difference is the selected Filter, that property is linked. Apart from that, a QueryFilterInstanceSchema has the same structure a Schema does.

    When principals (groups or users) are assigned to a project, they are receive roles in that project. Roles regulate access to specific resources by having permissions configured for them.

    Currently, this is only a stub.

    The schema provides more detailed information about the properties of a resource.
    The schema is represented by a dictionary containing names of resource properties as keys
    and objects describing the corresponding property as values.
    These objects are called **field schema** and form the core of the schema representation,
    each of them can contain its own `_links` and `_embedded` section.

    | _dependencies       | A list of dependencies between one property's value and another property           | SchemaDependency |

    The `_dependencies` property contains the list of dependencies that exist between the value selected for one of the properties of the described resource and the resource's structure. Depending on the value, additional properties might exist or properties might have other values allowed to be assigned. See [SchemaDependency](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/schemas/#schema-dependencies) for more information.

    # Field schema

    ## Linked Properties

    | Property             | Description                                                    | Conditions                                           |

    | allowedValues        | List of resources that are assignable by the current user.     | Will not exist if `allowedValuesSchemas` is present. |
    | allowedValuesSchemas | Link to schemas further describing the property.               | Will not exist if `allowedValues` is present.        |

    The `allowedValues` can either contain a list of canonical links or just a single link to a collection resource.
    This is an optimization to allow efficient handling of both small resource lists (that can be enumerated inline) and large
    resource lists (requiring one or more separate requests).

    The `allowedValuesSchemas` will on rare occasions (e.g. for a [Query](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/queries/)) replace `allowedValues`. This is done when there is no fixed set of allowed values. Instead, the allowed values will have to follow a schema, or one of a list of schemas, in its own right.

    Only one of the links (`allowedValues`, `allowedValuesSchemas`) will exist for any given property.

    | deprecated        | If present, the client should considere the existence of the property depreacated  | Boolean      | false   |

    All of the above properties that do not have a default value *must* be present in the schema.
    For properties that have a default value, the client can assume the default value, if the property is missing.

    Note that regular expressions used in the API follow the rules of [Ruby Regular Expressions](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.6/Regexp.html).

    ### Location property

    The location property gives a hint as to where to find the property if it is not contained in the set of local attributes.
    For example, for linked properties, the location attribute of the schema will contain `_links`. The property will then be found in the resource
    under the path `_links.propertyName`.

    For the default attributes to be added on the top level of the resource, the location attribute will not be set.

    # Schema Dependencies

    A SchemaDependency describes the dependencies between a value chosen for a resource's property and the resource's structure. By that, additional properties or changes in a property are described. A SchemaDependency will never describe a property to disappear, only to appear. As such it always provides additional information. For a property that is depending on another propertie's value, this can result in not being listed in the resource's schema itself at all. This will be the case if the existence of the a property as a whole will be dependent. If only one of the aspects (e.g. *writable*) of the property changes with the selected value, the property itself will already be listed in the schema, but it will lack the dependent aspect.

    Given that SchemaDependencies will only add information, and the content type of JSON, a client should be able to join the two objects, the schema and the dependency, into one object easily.

    SchemaDependencies are always embedded inside a Schema's `_dependencies` attribute. As such, they are not independently existing resources. Consequently, they do not have a `self` reference.

    ## Linked Properties

    A SchemaDependency does not have any links.

    ## Local Properties

    | Property            | Description                                                                        | Type             |

    | dependencies        | The additions to a schema grouped by the value of the depending property           | object           |

    The following excerpt exemplifies the objects that can be found as a value of the `dependencies` property:

    ```
    {
      "_type": "SchemaDependency",
      "on": "someProperty",
      "dependencies": {
        "1": {
          "loremIpsum": {
            "type": "User",
            "name": "Lorem ipsum",
            "required": true,
            "hasDefault": false,
            "writable": true,
            "location": "_links",
            "description": {
                "format": "markdown",
                "raw": "A description for field Lorem ipsum. This may contain [links](https://example.com).",
                "html": "<p>A description for field Lorem ipsum. This may contain <a href=\"https://exampel.com\">links</a>.</p>"
            };
            "_links": {
              "allowedValues": {
                "href": "/api/v3/some/path/to/users"
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "2": {
          "loremIpsum": {
            "type": "User",
            "name": "Lorem ipsum",
            "required": true,
            "hasDefault": false,
            "writable": true,
            "location": "_links",
            "_links": {
              "allowedValues": {
                "href": "/api/v3/a/totally/different/path/to/other/users"
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "3": {
          "loremIpsum": {
            "type": "User",
            "name": "Lorem ipsum",
            "required": true,
            "hasDefault": false,
            "writable": false,
            "location": "_links",
          }
        },
        "4": {}
      }
    }
    ```

    Given the example above, the client has to add the property `loremIpsum` to the schema if the depending property is `1`, `2` or `3`.
    If it is `4` the property does not exist.
    The property will not be writable if the value is `3`.
    The values allowed to be set differ between having `1` or `2` selected for the depending property.

    Because of the limitation of JSON objects, all keys will be strings, even when the depending value is actually something different (e.g. Integer, Date).
    This is also true for resources in which case the url of the resource is used as the key.

    Depending on custom fields defined for users, additional properties might exist.

    The `status` of a user can be one of:

    * `active` - the user can log in with the account right away

    * `invited` - the user is invited and is pending registration

    If the user's `status` is set to `active` during creation a means of authentication
    has to be provided which is one of the following:

    * `password` - The password with which the user logs in.

    * `auth_source` - Link to an LDAP auth source.

    * `identity_url` - The identity URL of an OmniAuth authentication provider.

    If all of these are missing the creation will fail with an "missing password" error.

    The `language` is limited to those activated in the system.

    Due to data privacy, the user's properties are limited to reveal as little about the user as possible.
    Thus `login`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `language`, `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are hidden for all
    users except for admins or the user themselves.

    Please note that custom fields are not yet supported by the api although the backend supports them.

    There will always be a query associated to the view when in the complete concept,
    this limitation should not be necessary.\n  * A query can only have one view associated.\n
    \ * There is neither an update nor a delete endpoint and the schema and form endpoints
    are also missing. \n    To delete a view, simply delete the query.\n  * Most of

    listed here only cover the built-in properties of the OpenProject Core.\nUsing
    plug-ins and custom fields a work package might contain various additional properties.\nA
    client can consult the schema information to which the work package links. The
    schema will contain information about\nall properties of the linking work package,
    including properties added by plug-ins and custom fields.\n\nCustom fields are
    identified by a key in the form of `customFieldN`, where `N` is an integer. Depending
    on their type,\nthey can occur as properties or as linked properties. A client
    has to consult the schema to resolve\nthe human readable name of custom fields.\n\nProperties
    that cannot be set directly on parent work packages are inferred from their children
    instead:\n\n* `startDate` is the earliest start date from its children if manual
    scheduling is activated.\n\n* `dueDate` is the latest finish date from its children
    if manual scheduling is activated.\n\n* `estimatedTime` is the sum of estimated
    times from its children\n\n* `percentageDone` is the weighted average of the sum
    of its children percentages done. The weight is given by the average of its children
    estimatedHours. However, if the percentage done is given by a work package's status,
    then only the status matters and no value is inferred.\n\n`startDate` can also
    not be earlier than a finish date of any predecessor.\n\nWhile attachments are
    returned as a link which's content is to be fetched separately, clients can choose
