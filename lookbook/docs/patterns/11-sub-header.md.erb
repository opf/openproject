This component is an own implementation for OpenProject requirements of contextual elements that affect the content of the page below. Such a component does not exist in the Primer Design System.

## Overview

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::SubHeaderPreview, :default %>

## Anatomy

**Filter input:** (Optional) It will change depending on the viewport:

- **Desktop:** A basic [text input](https://primer.style/components/text-input) with a [search icon](https://primer.style/components/text-input#with-leading-and-trailing-visuals) which is mostly used on index pages to filter the elements below.
- **Mobile:**
  - There will be an IconButton shown instead of the input
  - Clicking that, will show the input again and hide all other elements of the SubHeader
  - An additional cancel button is shown to return to the previous state

**Filter button:** (Optional)A button which is shown next to the filter input (or on the very left, if there is no filter input)

**Text:** (Optional) A bold text shown in the middle of the SubHeader

**Action buttons**: (Optional) A set of buttons that are shown on the right side


## Best practices

**Do**

- Restrict SubHeader actions to the page's content-specific actions (e.g. filtering or creating a new object).
- Use IconButtons instead of Buttons for actions only when the icon is clear enough to describe the action.

**Don't**

- Use the SubHeader to perform generic view actions (should be part of the PageHeader)

## Used in

* Project list
* Members
* Meetings
* Storages
* ...

## Examples


For detailed examples have a look at the other [preview examples](../../inspect/primer/open_project/sub_header/playground) of the component.

This is an exemplary playground of the `Primer::OpenProject::SubHeader`.
