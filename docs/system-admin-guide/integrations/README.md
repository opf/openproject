# Integrations and community plugins

There are various integrations and Community plugins out there. Please [contact us](https://www.openproject.org/contact/) if you want to have your plugin to be added to this list.

If you have previously worked with other tools and want to switch or need an integration to OpenProject, there is a way to do so for some applications.

> **Note**:  We do not guarantee error-free and seamless use of the Community plugins. Installation and use is at your own risk.

## Excel

Find out more about the [Excel synchronization with OpenProject](./excel-synchronization).

## GitHub

OpenProject offers a basic GitHub integration. You will find more information about the GitHub integration in our [GitHub integration guideline](./github-integration/).

OpenProject offers a GitLab integration, based on the [GitLab plugin contributed by the Community](https://github.com/btey/openproject-gitlab-integration). More information on the GitLab integration is available in our [GitLab integration guide](./gitlab-integration/).

## Jira

Currently, there is no direct integration between OpenProject and Jira. Since OpenProject is an excellent open source alternative to Jira, we have prepared a way to import tickets from Jira to OpenProject. First, you can export your tasks from Jira into an Excel file and then import these tasks via an [Excel plugin into OpenProject](./excel-synchronization).
