# Custom fields for projects

As a user of [OpenProject Enterprise on-premises](https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/) or [OpenProject Enterprise cloud](https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/#hosting-options) you can customize work package lists and show additional project information by adding custom attributes to project lists, e.g. adding accountable, project due date, progress, and more.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Starting with version 14.0, project custom fields are called "project attributes". Please refer to our [user guide on project attributes](../../../user-guide/project-overview) for more information.
>
>If you are an administrator and wish to configure project attributes, please refer to our [admin guide on project attributes](../../projects/project-attributes).
