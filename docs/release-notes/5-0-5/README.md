    a work package has been fixed
    ([\#22215](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22215/activity)).
  - The watch button on wiki pages, forums and news pages has been fixed
    ([\#22086](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22086/activity)).
  - The progress bars (e.g. in roadmap, budgets) are displayed properly
    again
    ([\#22225](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22225/activity)).
  - The “watch all” / “hide empty” button on the work package page has
    been renamed to be more descriptive
