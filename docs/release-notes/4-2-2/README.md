OpenProject 4.2.2 contains additional translations for the OpenProject
core and plugins, for instance complete translations for French

Additionally, some bugs have been fixed:

  - Several wrong English translations have been fixed – in the core and
    in plugins
    ([\#20901](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20901),
    [\#20902](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20902),
    [\#20859](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20859)).
  - The last login is no longer visible in the user profile
    ([\#20892](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20892)).
