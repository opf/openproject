# OpenProject 5.0.14

OpenProject 5.0.14 contains several bug fixes:

    selected. This has been adjusted
    ([\#22595](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22595/activity)).

    was logged on a work package. This has been fixed
    ([\#22485](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22485/activity)).
  - An error in the incoming emails functionality has been resolved
    ([\#22607](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22607/activity)).
  - Several design errors have been fixed
    ([\#20714](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20714/activity),
    [\#22497](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22497/activity),
