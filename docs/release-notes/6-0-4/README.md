# OpenProject 6.0.4

OpenProject 6.0.4 contains several bug and accessibility fixes.

**The following bugs have been fixed in OpenProject 6.0.4:**

  - The *+ New
    <span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-45">Project</span>*
    button was displayed even to users who didn’t have the permission to
    create new work packages
    ([\#23881](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23881/activity)).
  - <span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-7">Work
    package</span> attribute were sometimes not saved properly when
    multiple attributes were changed in quick succession
    ([\#23589](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23859)).
  - In the work package split screen the subject was not updated when it
    was changed in the work package list
    ([\#23879](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23879)).
  - The project list on the work package screen appeared to be ordered
    randomly. It’s now sorted alphabetically
    ([\#23786](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23786/activity)).
  - The global setting to display work packages from subprojects in main
    projects did not work
    ([\#23814](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23814/activity)).
  - The *Cancel* button on wiki pages was missing
    ([\#23829](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23829/activity)).
  - The link to add additional work package attachments on the wiki page
    redirected users to the landing page instead
    ([\#23820](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23820/activity)).
  - <span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-8">Wiki</span>
    menu items were showing the slug instead of the title
    ([\#23818](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23818/activity)).
  - The *Send for review* button on the meeting page did not work when a
    timezone was set
    ([\#23758](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23758)).
  - Cost reports grouped by year and months were displayed in the wrong
    order
    ([\#23773](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23773/activity)).
  - Several styling errors have been fixed
    ([\#23808](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23808/activity),
    [\#23834](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23834/activity)).
  - Several missing translations have been added (e.g.
    [\#23877](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23877/activity)).
