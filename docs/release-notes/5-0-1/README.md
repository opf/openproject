# OpenProject 5.0.1

OpenProject 5.0.1 contains several bug fixes and additional translations
for the OpenProject core and plugins.

The following bugs have been fixed with OpenProject 5.0.1:

  - An error in the documents plugin caused an error on the enumeration
    page
    ([\#22093](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22093/activity)).
  - A bug has been fixed which prevented custom fields for time tracking
    to be displayed
    ([\#22116](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22116/activity)).
  - An error which prevented managed remotes used for SVN to be
    accessible on localhost has been fixed
    ([\#22095](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22095/activity)).
  - The watch icon did not update the list of watchers when the user was
    on the watchers tab
    ([\#21946](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21946/activity)).
  - A redirect to work packages in private projects did not work when
    the user had to login first
    ([\#21868](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21868/activity)).
  - The work package create button was not disabled while creating a
    work package – leading to possible conflicts
    ([\#22070](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22070/activity)).
  - Several styling fixes have been applied
    ([\#22028](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22028/activity),
    [\#22062](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22062/activity)).
  - A wrong English translation has been adjusted
    ([\#22092](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22092/activity)).

In addition, new translations have been added to OpenProject and the
plugins.
