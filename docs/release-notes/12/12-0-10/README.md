# OpenProject 12.0.10

Release date: 2022-03-16

We released [OpenProject 12.0.10](https://community.openproject.org/versions/1512).
The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version.

## Localization issues

Some translations provided by our Crowdin integration were temporarily reverted to their english originals.
This has been fixed and is the primary reason for this release.

- Fixed: Several Translation Errors \[DE\] \[[#41414](https://community.openproject.org/wp/41414)\]
- Fixed: LOCALE env used for seeding is too generic \[[#41427](https://community.openproject.org/wp/41427)\]
- Fixed: Broken translation in russian/german language after upgrade to actual release \[[#41434](https://community.openproject.org/wp/41434)\]
