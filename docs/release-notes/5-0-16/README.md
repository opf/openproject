# OpenProject 5.0.16

OpenProject 5.0.16 contains several bug
    fixes:

  - <span class="explanatory-dictionary-highlight" data-definition="explanatory-dictionary-definition-7">Work
    package</span> links (via \#\# and \#\#\#) in emails sent when
    watching forums were not displayed properly. This has been fixed
    ([\#22728](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22728/activity)).
  - An error on the work package page has been fixed which caused
    multiple work packages to be created when clicking the “Create”
    button multiple times
    ([\#22735](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22735/activity)).
  - The selected work package type when creating a new child work
    package was not based on the type order displayed in the
    administration. This has been adjusted
    ([\#22639](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22639/activity)).
  - Due to an error the project list could not be accessed in the
    accessibility mode. This has been fixed.
  - The star icon in the project list showing which project the user is
    a member in was missing. It has been added
    ([\#22692](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22692/activity)).
  - In the cost report, the cells were not displayed properly when
    applying a grouping in the report. This has been fixed
    ([\#22762](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22762/activity)).
  - In the Task board the option to adjust the column width was only
    shown when the burndown chart option was available. It has been
    adjusted to always be displayed
    ([\#22297](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22297/activity)).
  - Several design issues have been fixed
    ([\#22805](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22805/activity),
    [\#22802](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22802/activity),
    [\#22803](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22803/activity),
    [\#22732](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22732/activity),
    [\#22716](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22716/activity),
    [\#22705](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22705/activity),
    [\#22686](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22686/activity),
    [\#21902](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21902/activity)).

Furthermore, the performance on the work package page has been improved
([\#22586](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22586/activity),
[\#22669](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22669/activity))
and several new icons have been added to the administration
([\#22063](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22063/activity)).

In addition, an error has been fixed which prevented the proper use to
the [TaskConnector for MS
Project](https://community.openproject.org/projects/task-connector).
This is now fully functional again
([\#22390](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22390/activity)).
