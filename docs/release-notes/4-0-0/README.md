## Integrated toolbar on work package page

OpenProject 4.0 replaces the old filter and options section on the work
package page with a convenient integrated toolbar.  
Now users no longer need to leave the work package list in order to use
many features that were previously only available on a separate
configuration page.  
In addition, filters are now expandable and it is possible to create
work packages right from the work package table.

possible to perform some of the most frequently used actions in the work
package table right on a column header.

  - Sort by column
  - Group by column attribute
  - Hide / Remove column
  - Add new column

## Split screen mode added to work package page

A split screen mode has been added to the work package table which
allows to display the work package details view alongside the work
package table, allowing a quick overview of work packages details
without leaving the overview page.  
The included work package details pane is separated in the different
tabs **Overview, Activity, Relations, Watchers** and **Attachments**,
allowing users to see the most important information at a glance.
