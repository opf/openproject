# OpenProject 5.0.15

OpenProject 5.0.15 contains several bug fixes:

  - The date on the project activity was based on UTC+0 and therefore
    showed the wrong date when being in a different time zone
    ([\#22641](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22641/activity)).
  - When selecting a query and updating several work packages at once
    using bulk edit, the focus was lost to the work package page. It now
    remains on the query
    ([\#22330](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22330/activity)).
  - Due to an error the search text for queries in the dark theme was
    not visible. This has been fixed
    ([\#22654](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22654)).
  - Several design improvements have been
    made ([\#21338](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21338/activity),
    [\#21794](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21794/activity)).

In addition, the accessibility has been improved
([\#21910](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21910/activity),
[\#22005](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22005/activity)).

For further information on the release, please refer to the [Changelog
v.5.0.15](https://community.openproject.org/versions/783) or take a look
