# OpenProject 4.2.5

OpenProject 4.2.5 contains bug fixes and updated translations.

The following bugs have been fixed:

  - When an action is performed on the work package split screen, the
    toolbar is correctly displayed. Before, the toolbar and pagination
    were partly hidden
    ([\#21204](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21204)).
  - An error has been fixed which caused a random language to be
    displayed when first logging into an OpenProject instance if no
    language has been configured
    ([\#21119](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21119)).
  - For users of OpenProject-CE packager installation on CentOS, a bug
    has been fixed which affects a wrong autostart configuration
    ([\#21126](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21126)).

Additionally, new translations have been included (including complete
translations for Swedish).

v.4.2.5](https://community.openproject.org/versions/759) or take a look
