# OpenProject 5.0.18

OpenProject 5.0.18 contains several bug fixes:

  - The wiki toolbar did not work. This has been fixed
    ([#23050](https://community.openproject.org/wp/23050)).
  - When a project contains no members the button to add a member on the
    project overview was not displayed. Also the link on the button was
    wrong. This has been fixed
    ([#22970](https://community.openproject.org/wp/22970)).
  - Some of the links on the landing page were wrong and have been
    corrected
    ([#22967](https://community.openproject.org/wp/22967)).
  - An error preventing exported PDFs to be opened on Mac OS X El
    Capitan has been fixed
    ([#22730](https://community.openproject.org/wp/22730)).
  - Gravatars were not properly loaded. This has been fixed
    ([#5120](https://community.openproject.org/wp/5120)).

In addition, there are several design and usability improvements:

  - The styling for the documents module was missing. This has been
    fixed
    ([#23158](https://community.openproject.org/wp/23158)).
  - Several improvements have been made to responsive / mobile layouts
    ([#22953](https://community.openproject.org/wp/22953),
    [#22944](https://community.openproject.org/wp/22944)).
  - Several design errors have been fixed
    ([#23109](https://community.openproject.org/wp/23109),
    [#23104](https://community.openproject.org/wp/23104),
    [#23052](https://community.openproject.org/wp/23052),
    [#23046](https://community.openproject.org/wp/23046),
    [#22997](https://community.openproject.org/wp/22997)).
  - Many accessibility improvements have been made.

The textbox above a forum does now render textile. It’s therefore
possible to e.g. include links or references
([#23180](https://community.openproject.org/wp/23180)).
