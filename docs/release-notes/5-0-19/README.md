# OpenProject 5.0.19

OpenProject 5.0.19 contains several bug fixes:

  - An error has been resolved which prevented the assignment of work
    packages to groups when editing a work package
    ([\#23099](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23099/activity)).
  - An error in the calculation of the progress of work packages with
    children has been fixed
    ([\#23251](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23251/activity)).
  - The burndown chart on the backlogs page was broken when a language
    other than English was selected. This has been fixed
    ([\#23253](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23253/activity)).
  - The context menu on the backlogs page did not disappear when an
    entry was selected. This has been resolved
    ([\#22837](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/22837/activity)).
  - It was not possible to delete files attached to a budget. This has
    been fixed
    ([\#23110](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23110/activity)).
  - When creating or editing budgets and assigning groups for the
    planned labor costs, “Deleted user” was shown instead of the group
    name. This has been resolved
    ([\#23057](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23057/activity)).
  - A security error has been fixed which allowed Angular injections in
    texts
    ([\#23073](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23073/activity)).
