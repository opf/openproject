# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for calendar

## What information can be displayed in the calendar?

The calendar automatically displays the start and end dates of work  packages in the current project. Additionally, the start and end dates of versions are shown in the calendar.

## Where can I embed / activate the calendar?

To use the calendar in a project, you need to [activate the “Calendar” module in the project settings](../../projects/project-settings/modules). Afterwards you can access the calendar in the project menu, as well as add it in the [project overview](../../projects/#view-all-projects). You can also enable the calendar in your [“My page” view](../../../getting-started/my-page).

## Is there an option to export or sync my calendar (e.g. Outlook)?

It is currently not possible to export or sync the calendar. 

You can however use the meeting module in OpenProject to organize meetings and invite project members.  You can [export meetings as iCalendar file](../..meetings/#create-or-edit-the-meeting-agenda) and import them to your external calendar. If you would like Microsoft Outlook to automatically import calendar invites, please check your Outlook settings and make sure to give permission from that side.

## Are holidays considered in the calendar?

Currently, the calendar does not consider weekends or holidays as non-working days, i.e. the end date for a task could e.g. be set on a Sunday. This is important for businesses that are working on weekends or holidays. Please note that we are currently working on a feature for holidays and weekends that can be adjusted as needed. 

## Is there a limit for the number of work packages displayed in the calendar?

The limit is 100 and can't be changed at the moment. Find the respective feature request [here](https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/35062/activity).
