# User guide

Welcome to the OpenProject User guide.

This guide covers all of OpenProject's functionalities from a user's perspective.

## Overview of projects in OpenProject

Your work within OpenProject can be organized into multiple projects, each with a distinct set of members and their respective roles in that project.  In turn, each project can be individually configured with regards to the enabled features, called *Modules* in OpenProject. This distinction between projects provides you with a lot of flexibility to set up your work, and control what users are allowed to view and/or collaborate on in each individual project.

Both the Community edition and Enterprise edition allow you to create an unlimited number of projects to separate your work. To learn more about the creation and management of projects within OpenProject, [please visit our separate section on projects](projects/).

## Overview of modules in OpenProject

<div class="glossary">

**Module** is defined as an independent unit of functionality that can be used to extend and improve the existing core functions.

</div>

Within a project Modules can be activated and deactivated under "Modules" in the project settings menu by project members who have sufficient permissions to adjust project settings. Which modules or single functionalities will be available within projects is controlled in the global Administration settings (please see [System admin guide](../system-admin-guide/projects) to see how this is done).

Please choose the module or feature you want to learn more about.
