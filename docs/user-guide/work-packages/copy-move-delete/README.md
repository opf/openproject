# Copy, change project or delete a work package

If you click with the right mouse button in the line of the work package, a list with different editing options for the selected work package opens. Here you can copy the work package, delete it and move it to another project. You can access these features from the work package table or from within a work package.

You can also dit a work package using the three dots at the far right of a row to access the menu.

To copy, move or delete multiple work packages at once please refer to the documentation for [bulk edit](../edit-work-package/#bulk-edit-work-packages). 

## Copy a work package

When copying a work package, a work package form with the pre-set values of the original work package is shown.

Copying a work package allows to easily create and adjust new work packages based on existing one’s.

## Move a work package to a different project.

The *change project* option moves a work package to another project or subproject. Select the project into which the work package is to be moved, check whether further adjustments are necessary and confirm by clicking on *Move*.

> **Note**:  You can only move a work package into projects that you are a member of and for which you are authorized to carry out this function.

## Delete a work package

The right to delete work packages is tied to specified roles (for example system administrators). The roles and permission may vary from project to project.

You can select these options either in the detail view under *More* or via the context menu by right-clicking into the work package table. The latter option allows you to perform an action (such as copying, moving or deleting a work package) on multiple work packages at once.
