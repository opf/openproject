# Work packages

<div class="glossary">
**Work packages** are items in a project (such as tasks, features, risks, user stories, bugs, change requests). A work package captures important information and can be assigned to project members for execution. 
</div>

Work packages have a **type**, an **ID**, a **subject** and may have various additional attributes, such as **status**, **assignee**, **priority**, **due date**.

<div class="glossary">**Work package ID** is defined as a unique integer assigned to a newly created work package. Work package IDs cannot be changed and are numbered across all projects of an OpenProject instance (therefore, the numbering within a project may not be sequential). 
</div>

<div class="glossary">
**Types** are the different items a work package can represent, such as task, feature, bug, phase, milestone. The work package types can be configured in the system administration. 
</div>




Work packages can be displayed in a projects timeline, e.g. as a milestone or a phase. In order to use the work packages, the work package module has to be activated in the project settings.
