# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for project overview

## When I set up the overview page for a project, work packages can be arranged as a Gantt chart. I would also need this for the subprojects, how does it work?

If you have selected the "Work package table" widget in the overview page, you can select a small mini-menu at the top right of the widget and click on **Configure view**. There you can also select subprojects under *Filter*. There you can either select all subprojects, only one or several subprojects. And in the *Gantt chart* tab of the Work package table configuration, tick the box next to "Show Gantt chart". All work packages of the selected subprojects will then be shown in a common Gantt chart view.
If you want to see the individual Gantt charts of the subprojects separately, you need to add a widget to the work package table for each subproject.
