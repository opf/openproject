# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for start page

## Can I edit the start page?

Only the welcome block/text can be edited, the rest can't. However, you can change the theme and logo of your OpenProject instance [this way](../../system-admin-guide/design) if you use Enterprise on-premises or Enterprise cloud.
