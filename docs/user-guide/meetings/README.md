# Meeting management

Meetings in OpenProject allow you to manage and document your project meetings, prepare a meeting agenda together with your team and document and share minutes with attendees, all in one central place.

<div class="glossary">
**Meetings** is defined as a module that allows the organization of meetings.
**Note:** In order to be able to use the meetings plugin, the **Meetings module needs to be activated** in the [Project Settings](../projects/project-settings/modules/).
</div>

## Meetings in OpenProject

You can view existing meetings within a project or create a new meeting by selecting the **Meetings** module on the left-hand project menu. Alternatively, you can access the transversal cross-project **Meetings** module from the [global modules](../home/global-modules/) menu.

>With OpenProject 13.1.0 there will be two types of meetings that you can create: [dynamic](dynamic-meetings/) and [classic](classic-meetings). Please keep in mind that the ability to create classic meetings will eventually be removed from OpenProject.
