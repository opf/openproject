## FAQ

### Can I create a custom project status?

There are six project status to choose from: on track, at risk, off track, not started, finished and discontinued. These cannot be changed. However, if you want to add additional information, you can do so in the status description or you can create an additional [project custom field](../../../system-admin-guide/custom-fields/custom-fields-projects/). Both, status description and the project custom field can be displayed in the **project list**.
