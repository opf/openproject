# Search features

There are two ways to search for work packages, documents, projects, etc. in OpenProject: The search bar and the advanced search. 

## Search bar

The search bar can be found at the upper right of the application. To search for work package subjects, enter the terms you're looking for and do not press the Enter key. An auto-completer will suggest matching work packages from all projects you have access to. You can either click on them or right-click and open them in a new tab.

Searching for e.g. "big cat" will also return work packages with the description "big old cat".

## Advanced search

To access the more detailed, advanced search, choose one of the options shown below the search bar with your arrow keys (then press the Enter key) or by using the mouse.

If you do not have a project open at the moment, the first two options won't be shown.

Now, you can find the results for your search term from different categories/parts of OpenProject. In the work packages section you can click on **Advanced filter** to access additional filter options (the same as in other work package lists).

Please note: It is not possible to find content from archived projects. You will have to un-archive them first on the [global projects overview page](../projects/#global-projects-overview---view-all-projects).
