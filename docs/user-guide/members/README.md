## Add members

Find out how to [add existing members](../../getting-started/#add-existing-members) to join a project or [invite new team members](../../getting-started/#invite-new-members).

## Remove members

To remove members from a project, [select the project](../projects/#select-a-project) where you want to remove the members. In the project menu on the left, select the **Members** menu item. In the members list, click on the **bin** **icon** at the very right in a line of the member name.

## Roles and permissions

Members will have different roles with different permissions in a project. To find out how to [configure roles and permissions](../../system-admin-guide/#roles-permissions).

<div class="glossary">A **role** is defined as a set of permissions defined by a unique name. Project members are assigned to a project by specifying a user's or group's name and the role(s) the user should assume in the project.</div>

## Groups

Members can be added to groups. Find out how to [create and manage groups](../../system-admin-guide/#groups) in OpenProject.
