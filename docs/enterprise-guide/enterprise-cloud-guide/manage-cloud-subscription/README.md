- Edit Account information
- Edit Billing Addresses
- Edit or add payment methods
- [View billing history and download invoices](../invoices-and-billing-history)

## Update existing subscriptions

If you want to up- or downgrade the amount of users of an existing subscription, click on the subscription listed at the top.

Here you can either **Edit or Cancel the existing subscription**.

### Upgrade or downgrade subscription

You can **upgrade an existing subscription** at any time. Open the [Manage subscription menu](#manage-your-openproject-enterprise-cloud-subscription). Additional users will be billed on a prorated basis, this means you will only pay for the additional users for the rest of the current subscription period.

You can **downgrade a subscription** to the end of a current subscription period. This means the downgrade becomes active with the next payment term.

Click the **Edit Subscription** link.

Click the blue **Update your subscription now button** to save the changes.
