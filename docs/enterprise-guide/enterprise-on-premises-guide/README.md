# Enterprise on-premises guide

Welcome to the OpenProject **Enterprise on-premises guide**.

Here you find support for the [OpenProject Enterprise on-premises](https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/) edition. The Enterprise on-premises extends the Community edition and provides **Enterprise add-ons**, additional **security feature**s as well as **professional support**.

The Enterprise on-premises edition builds on top of the free Community edition. An upgrade is possible at any time. Please have a look at the detailed [feature comparison](https://www.openproject.org/pricing/#features) between the different versions of OpenProject.

> **Note**: This guide only describes the administration part of the OpenProject Enterprise on-premises edition. The feature descriptions for the Enterprise add-ons are included in the respective parts of the OpenProject [user guide](../../user-guide/).
