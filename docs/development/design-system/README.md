# Design System and Component Libraries

Starting in OpenProject 13.0., the [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/design/) is being used in OpenProject. Relevant reusable components from Primer as well as common patterns and compositions of these components will be documented in our [Lookbook](https://qa.openproject-edge.com/lookbook/).

Prior to 13.0., components were defined in its own Design System called SPOT which is slowly being replaced by Primer. Components still defined for SPOT are documented in a storybook found here: https://opf.github.io/design-system
