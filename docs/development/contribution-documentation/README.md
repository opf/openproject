# Contribute to the OpenProject documentation

## How do I get access to the OpenProject Community installation?

To get an account for community.openproject.org, please write an email with the subject 'Joining community' to [support@openproject.com](mailto:support@openproject.com), if you would like to join our Community. We will then invite you as soon as possible.

## What does the OpenProject documentation entail?

The OpenProject documentation makes available user guides, system admin, installation and operation, API as well as development guides and release notes.

Current and future users of the application find instructions for the set up and configuration of OpenProject in the documentation. Furthermore, it contains use cases and usage instructions for all OpenProject features and the use of OpenProject with other applications.

This documentation evolves continuously with new features and improvements to achieve clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

## Where to find the OpenProject documentation?

The documentation for OpenProject is published [here](https://www.openproject.org/docs/). You can also access the documentation from your OpenProject application under user guides and API documentation below the question mark at the top right in the header menu.

## Who can contribute to the documentation?

Being proudly open source, we invite anyone in our community to contribute to our software as well as the documentation to improve it even further.

## What can you contribute to the documentation?

Documentation improvements and changes apply to the documentation described in the section above. Documentation changes are **not** changes or additions to the code of the OpenProject application. For contributions to the code, see our [product development guide](../product-development-handbook/).

We are looking forward to receiving the following contributions from you:

- Eliminating errors and working on other improvements in the existing documentation. This could be missing content, e.g. descriptions or step-by-step guides for features.

- Adding use cases.

- Adding visuals, e.g. screenshots, to complement descriptions.

- Fixing of spelling, grammar, punctuation mistakes.

- Fixing of internal and external links that are not working or are incorrect.

- Translations into your mother tongue (coming soon).
