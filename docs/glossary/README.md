# OpenProject Glossary

## Accessibility mode

OpenProject offers an accessibility mode which is defined as an optimized user interface for physically disabled users. The accessibility mode can be activated in the account settings (System preferences). Note: When activated, the backlogs plugin cannot be used. Accessibility is an important topic for OpenProject and we strive to comply to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). Nevertheless, accessibility is a big field which takes time to implement and not all elements in OpenProjects are barrier-free - yet.

## Agile project management

Agile project management is an iterative and flexible approach to managing projects. It focuses on collaboration, adaptability, and self-organizing teams. OpenProject supports agile project management as well as *classic project management* and works best for *hybrid project management*.

## Authentication

In Openproject, authentication is an important element to guarantee a data protected usage. To adapt these authentication settings, navigate to your user name and select -> Administration -> Authentication. At OpenProject, we use *OAuth 2.0* as this is this is the definitive industry standard for online authorization.

## Dashboard

A dashboard is defined as an overview page in a software. In OpenProject, you have several options to create dashboards:

First, you have the "***My Page\***" which shows your personal customized widgets on one page, for example a calendar or work package reports.

Then, you can create **private dashboards inside your project** by filtering a work package view and then saving it under a new name. For example, filter all work packages assigned to yourself and save this view as "assigned to me", to quickly navigate to those work packages.

Admins of a project can also create **dashboards that are visible to everyone in the project**.

Projects are the central organizational unit in OpenProject. Your projects can be available publicly or internally. OpenProject does not limit the number of projects, neither in the Community edition nor in the Enterprise cloud or in Enterprise on-premises edition. If you have more than one project in your instance, projects build a structure in OpenProject. You can have parent projects and sub-projects. For example, a project can represent

## Work package

In OpenProject, a [work package](https://www.openproject.org/docs/user-guide/work-packages/#overview) is defined as an item in a project. It is a subset of a project that can be assigned to users for execution, such as Tasks, Bugs, User Stories, Milestones, and more. Work packages have a type, an ID and a subject and may have additional attributes, such as assignee, responsible, story points or target version. Work packages are displayed in a project timeline (unless they are filtered out in the timeline configuration) - either as a milestone or as a phase. In order to use the work packages, the work package module has to be activated in the project settings.

![A work package in OpenProject](glossary-openproject-work-package.png)

### Work package types
