    When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing the properties and links that it wants to change, in the body.
    Note that it is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the **write** operation.

    Additionally to the fields the client wants to change, it is mandatory to provide the value of `lockVersion` which was received
    by the `GET` request this change originates from.

    The value of `lockVersion` is used to implement [optimistic locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control).
