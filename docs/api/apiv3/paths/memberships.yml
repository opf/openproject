  parameters:
  - description: |-
      JSON specifying filter conditions.
      Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/queries/) endpoint.
      Currently supported filters are:

      + any_name_attribute: filters memberships based on the name of the principal. All possible name variants (and also email and login) are searched.

      + blocked: reduces the result set to all memberships that are temporarily blocked or that are not blocked temporarily.

      + group: filters memberships based on the name of a group. The group however is not the principal used for filtering. Rather, the memberships of the group are used as the filter values.

      + name: filters memberships based on the name of the principal. Note that only the name is used which depends on a setting in the OpenProject instance.

      + principal: filters memberships based on the id of the principal.

      + project: filters memberships based on the id of the project.

      + role: filters memberships based on the id of any role assigned to the membership.

      + status: filters memberships based on the status of the principal.

      + created_at: filters memberships based on the time the membership was created.

      + updated_at: filters memberships based on the time the membership was updated last.
    example: '[{ "name": { "operator": "=", "values": ["A User"] }" }]'

      JSON specifying sort criteria.
      Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/queries/) endpoint. Currently supported sorts are:

      + id: Sort by primary key

      + name: Sort by the name of the principal. Note that this depends on the setting for how the name is to be displayed at least for users.

      + email: Sort by the email address of the principal. Groups and principal users, which do not have an email, are sorted last.

      + status: Sort by the status of the principal. Groups and principal users, which do not have a status, are sorted together with the active users.

      + created_at: Sort by membership creation datetime

      + updated_at: Sort by the time the membership was updated last

    Creates a new membership applying the attributes provided in the body.

    You can use the form and schema to retrieve the valid attribute values and by that be guided towards successful creation.

    By providing a `notificationMessage` within the `_meta` block of the payload, the client can include a customized message to the user
    of the newly created membership. In case of a group, the message will be sent to every user belonging to the group.

    By including `{ "sendNotifications": false }` within the `_meta` block of the payload, no notifications is send out at all.
