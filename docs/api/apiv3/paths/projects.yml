  - description: |-
      JSON specifying filter conditions.
      Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/queries/) endpoint.
      Currently supported filters are:

      + active: based on the active property of the project

      + ancestor: filters projects by their ancestor. A project is not considered to be it's own ancestor.

      + created_at: based on the time the project was created

      + latest_activity_at: based on the time the last activity was registered on a project.

      + name_and_identifier: based on both the name and the identifier.

      + parent_id: filters projects by their parent.

      + principal: based on members of the project.

      + type_id: based on the types active in a project.

      + user_action: based on the actions the current user has in the project.

      + id: based on projects' id.

      + visible: based on the visibility for the user (id) provided as the filter value. This filter is useful for admins to identify the projects visible to a user.
      There might also be additional filters based on the custom fields that have been configured.
    example: '[{ "ancestor": { "operator": "=", "values": [''1''] }" }]'
