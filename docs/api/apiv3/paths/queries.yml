      JSON specifying filter conditions.
      Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](#queries) endpoint.
      Currently supported filters are:

      + project: filters queries by the project they are assigned to. If the project filter is passed with the `!*` (not any) operator, global queries are returned.

      + id: filters queries based on their id

      + updated_at: filters queries based on the last time they where updated
    example: '[{ "project_id": { "operator": "!*", "values": null }" }]'
