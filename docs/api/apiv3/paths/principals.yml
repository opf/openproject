      JSON specifying filter conditions.
      Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/queries/) endpoint.
      Currently supported filters are:

      + type: filters principals by their type (*User*, *Group*, *PlaceholderUser*).

      + member: filters principals by the projects they are members in.

      + name: filters principals by the user or group name.

      + any_name_attribute: filters principals by the user or group first- and last name, email or login.

      + status: filters principals by their status number (active = *1*, registered = *2*, locked = *3*, invited = *4*)
    example: '[{ "type": { "operator": "=", "values": ["User"] } }]'

    similar to how work packages are filtered. In addition to the provided filters,
    the server will reduce the result set to only contain principals who are members
    in projects the client is allowed to see.
