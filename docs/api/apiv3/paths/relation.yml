    When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing the properties and links that it wants to change, in the body.
    It is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the **write** operation.

    Note that changing the `type` of a relation invariably also changes the respective `reverseType` as well as the "name" of it.
    The returned Relation object will reflect that change. For instance if you change a Relation's
    `type` to "follows" then the `reverseType` will be changed to `precedes`.
