  The configuration endpoint allows to read certain configuration parameters of the OpenProject instance.
  Note that there is no 1:1 relationship between this endpoint and the settings an administrator has at hand to modify the behaviour
  of the application via configuration.yml or ENV variables.

  For now this endpoint will only allow access to settings deemed useful for a client to know in general.

  As clients might rely on the combination of both, the system settings as well as the current user's preferences, the resource
  embeds the current user's preferences so client can fetch both with one request.
