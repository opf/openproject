# Group Queries

A query defines how work packages can be filtered and displayed. Clients can define a query once, store it, and use it later on to load the same set of filters.

A query that is not assigned to a project (`"project": null`) is called a global query. Global queries filter work packages regardless of the project they are assigned to. As such, a different set of filters exists for those queries.

## Query Filter Instance

A QueryFilterInstance defines a filtering applied to the list of work packages. As such it contains:
* the filter type (`QueryFilter`) used
* the operator (`QueryOperator`) used
* the list of values

The list of values can either consist of a list of links or of a list of strings. If the values are primitive (e.g. Integer, Boolean, Date) they will be displayed as strings and the QueryFilterInstance will have a `values` property.

```
  {
    "_type": "DueDateQueryFilter",
    "name": "Finish date",
    "values": [
      "1"
    ],
    "_links": {
      "filter": {
        "href": "/api/v3/queries/filters/dueDate",
        "title": "Finish date"
      },
      "operator": {
        "href": "/api/v3/queries/operators/<t+",
        "title": "in less than"
      }
      "schema": {
        "href": "/api/v3/queries/filter_instance_schemas/dueDate"
      }
    }
  }
```

If the values are nonprimitive (e.g. User, Project), they will be listed as objects and the QueryFilterInstance will have a `values` link.

## View query [GET]

Retreive an individual query as identified by the id parameter. Then end point accepts a number of parameters that can be used to override the resources' persisted parameters.

+ Parameters
    + id (required, integer, `1`) ... Query id
    + filters = `[{ "status_id": { "operator": "o", "values": null }}]` (optional, string, `[{ "assignee": { "operator": "=", "values": ["1", "5"] }" }]`) ... JSON specifying filter conditions.
    The filters provided as parameters are not applied to the query but are instead used to override the query's persisted filters.
    All filters also accepted by the work packages endpoint are accepted. If no filter is to be applied, the client should send an empty array (`[]`).
    + offset = `1` (optional, integer, `25`) ... Page number inside the queries' result collection of work packages.
    + pageSize = `DEPENDING ON CONFIGURATION` (optional, integer, `25`) ... Number of elements to display per page for the queries' result collection of work packages.
    + columns = `['type', 'priority']` (optional, object, `[]`) ... Selected columns for the table view. 
    + sortBy = ["id", "asc"] (optional, string, `[["status", "asc"]]`) ... JSON specifying sort criteria. The sort criteria is applied to the querie's result collection of work packages overriding the query's persisted sort criteria.
    + groupBy (optional, string, `status`) ... The column to group by. The grouping criteria is applied to the to the querie's result collection of work packages overriding the query's persisted group criteria.
    + showSums = `false` (optional, boolean, `true`) ... Indicates whether properties should be summed up if they support it. The showSums parameter is applied to the to the querie's result collection of work packages overriding the query's persisted sums property.
    + timelineVisible = `false` (optional, boolean, `true`) ... Indicates whether the timeline should be shown.
    + timelineLabels = `{}` (optional, object, `{}`) ... Overridden labels in the timeline view
    + highlightingMode = `inline` (optional, object, `inline`) ... Highlighting mode for the table view.
    + highlightedAttributes = `['type', 'priority']` (optional, object, `[]`) ... Highlighted attributes mode for the table view when `highlightingMode` is `inline`. When set to `[]` all highlightable attributes will be returned as `highlightedAttributes`.
    + showHierarchies = `true` (optional, boolean, `true`) ... Indicates whether the hierarchy mode should be enabled.

## View default query [GET]

Same as [viewing an existing, persisted Query](#queries-query-get) in its response, this resource returns an unpersisted query and by that allows to get the default query configuration. The client may also provide additional parameters which will modify the default query.

+ Parameters
    + filters = `[{ "status_id": { "operator": "o", "values": null }}]` (optional, string, `[{ "assignee": { "operator": "=", "values": ["1", "5"] }" }]`) ... JSON specifying filter conditions.
    The filters provided as parameters are not applied to the query but are instead used to override the query's persisted filters.
    All filters also accepted by the work packages endpoint are accepted. If no filter is to be applied, the client should send an empty array (`[]`).
    + offset = `1` (optional, integer, `25`) ... Page number inside the queries' result collection of work packages.
    + pageSize = `DEPENDING ON CONFIGURATION` (optional, integer, `25`) ... Number of elements to display per page for the queries' result collection of work packages.
    + sortBy = ["id", "asc"] (optional, string, `[["status", "asc"]]`) ... JSON specifying sort criteria. The sort criteria is applied to the querie's result collection of work packages overriding the query's persisted sort criteria.
    + groupBy (optional, string, `status`) ... The column to group by. The grouping criteria is applied to the to the querie's result collection of work packages overriding the query's persisted group criteria.
    + showSums = `false` (optional, boolean, `true`) ... Indicates whether properties should be summed up if they support it. The showSums parameter is applied to the to the querie's result collection of work packages overriding the query's persisted sums property.
    + timelineVisible = `false` (optional, boolean, `true`) ... Indicates whether the timeline should be shown.
    + timelineZoomLevel = `days` (optional, string, `days`) ... Indicates in what zoom level the timeline should be shown. Valid values are  `days`, `weeks`, `months`, `quarters`, and `years`.
    + showHierarchies = `true` (optional, boolean, `true`) ... Indicates whether the hierarchy mode should be enabled.

## List queries [GET]

Returns a collection of queries. The collection can be filtered via query parameters similar to how work packages are filtered. Please note however, that the filters are applied to the queries and not to the work packages the queries in turn might return.

+ Parameters
    + filters (optional, string, `[{ "project_id": { "operator": "!*", "values": null }" }]`) ... JSON specifying filter conditions.
    Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](#queries) endpoint.
    Currently supported filters are:
      + project: filters queries by the project they are assigned to. If the project filter is passed with the `!*` (not any) operator, global queries are returned.
      + id: filters queries based on their id
      + updated_at: filters queries based on the last time they where updated

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    [Queries][]

+ Response 403 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the client does not have sufficient permissions to see queries.

    **Required permission:** view work packages or manage public queries in any project

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:MissingPermission",
                "message": "You are not allowed to see the queries."
            }

## Create query [POST]

When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing at least the properties and links that are required, in the body.
The required fields of a Query can be found in its schema, which is embedded in the respective form.
Note that it is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the write operation.

+ Response 201 (application/hal+json)

    [Query][]

+ Response 400 (application/hal+json)

    Occurs when the client did not send a valid JSON object in the request body.

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:InvalidRequestBody",
                "message": "The request body was not a single JSON object."
            }

+ Response 422 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if:

    * the client tries to modify a read-only property (`PropertyIsReadOnly`)
    * a constraint for a property was violated (`PropertyConstraintViolation`)
    * the client provides a link to an invalid resource (`ResourceTypeMismatch`),
      e.g. a user, project or operator not found

    + Body

            {
                "_type": "Error",
                "errorIdentifier": "urn:openproject-org:api:v3:errors:PropertyConstraintViolation",
                "message": "Project not found",
                "_embedded": {
                    "details": {

                }
            }

## Query Create Form [/api/v3/queries/form]

This endpoint returns a form to allow a guided creation of a new query.
The returned form will be pre-filled with default values for every property, if available.

For more details and all possible responses see the general specification of [Forms](/api/forms).

## Query Create Form [POST]

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

Returns the form resource that was created. See [Forms](/api/forms) section for details.

# Group Query Columns

A QueryColumn can be referenced by a Query to denote the work package properties the client should display for the work packages returned as query results. The columns maps to the WorkPackage by the id property. QueryColumns exist in three types: QueryColumn::Property, QueryColumn::RelationToType and QueryColumn::RelationOfType.

## Group Query Filter Instance Schema

A QueryFilterInstanceSchema is a Schema specifically for describing QueryFilterInstances. Because the behaviour of FilterInstances, with regards to the `values` property, differs from one another depending on the choosen Filter, the QueryFilterInstanceSchema explicitly lists the dependencies in its `_dependencies` property. As the property causing the difference is the selected Filter, that property is linked. Apart from that, a QueryFilterInstanceSchema has the same structure a Schema does.
