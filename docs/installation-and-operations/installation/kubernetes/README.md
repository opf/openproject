# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool. As such it can use the
OpenProject docker container in the same manner as shown in the [docker section](../docker/#one-container-per-process-recommended).

In the [openproject-deploy](https://github.com/opf/openproject-deploy/blob/stable/14/kubernetes/README.md) repository we provide further information and an exemplary set of YAML files defining a complete OpenProject setup on Kubernetes.
