# Installing OpenProject

OpenProject can be setup in three different ways:

| ----------- | :---------- |
| [Installation with DEB/RPM packages](./packaged) | This is the recommended way to install OpenProject |
| [Installation with docker](./docker) | This method of installation will undergo some changes soon and is currently not recommended |
| [Installation with Univention Corporate Server](./univention) | OpenProject is available in the App Center and comes integrated with the identity management |

**We recommend downloading the DEB/RPM package installation.**
