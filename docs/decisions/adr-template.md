# {short title, representative of solved problem and found solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

{Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences or in the form of an illustrative story. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question and add links to collaboration boards or issue management systems.}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->

## Decision Drivers

- {decision driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
- {decision driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
- … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

- {title of option 1}
- {title of option 2}
- {title of option 3}
- … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because {justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.
{Also, briefly describe why other options were not chosen, e.g., do not meet k.o. criterion decision driver | do not resolve force {force} | … | come out worse (see below)}.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->

### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR can/will be confirmed. Is it possible to create a RuboCop rule or create a GitHub action that can enforce compliance. Are the design that was decided for and its implementation in line with the decision made? E.g., a design/code review or a test with a library such as ArchUnit can help validate this. Note that although we classify this element as optional, it is included in many ADRs.}
