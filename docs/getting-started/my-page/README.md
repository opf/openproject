## My Page introduction

My Page is your personal dashboard where you can display important information of your projects. This personal dashboard contains information from all your projects. **My page** can be configured according to your preferences. You can include project information, for example the latest news, work packages assigned to you or reported work packages.

You can open your **My page** by clicking on your user avatar in the upper right corner and then selecting **My page** from the dropdown menu.

### Configure the view of a widget (for work package tables)

You can configure the view of a work package widget to have the information included that you need.

<div class="glossary">
**Work package** is a subset of a project that can be assigned to users for execution, such as Tasks, Bugs, User Stories, Milestones, and more. Work packages have a type, an ID and a subject and may have additional attributes, such as assignee, responsible, story points or target version. Work packages are displayed in a projects timeline (unless they are filtered out in the timeline configuration) - either as milestone or as phase. In order to use the work packages, the work package module has to be activated in the project settings.
</div>
​          

On a work package widget, click the three dots and select **Configure view...**

You can configure the work package table (e.g. filter, group, highlight, sort) according to the [filter, sorting and grouping criteria for work packages](../../user-guide/work-packages/work-package-table-configuration/).

## My spent time widget

To track spent time, [add the **My spent time** widget](#add-widgets) in the My Page.

You can directly create new time entries by clicking on the day, change the date with drag and drop, edit or remove time entries.

Watch the short video to see how to activate the spent time widget, add spent time, edit spent time (e.g. change the date or work packages or change the time booked) and delete spent time.
