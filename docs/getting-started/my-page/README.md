## My Page introduction

My Page is your personal dashboard where you can display important information of your projects. This personal dashboard contains information from all your projects. **My page** can be configured according to your preferences. You can include project information, for example the latest news, work packages assigned to you or reported work packages.

You can open your **My page** by clicking on your user avatar in the upper right corner and then selecting **My page** from the dropdown menu.

As a default, you will see two lists of all **work packages assigned to you** and **work packages created by you** from all your projects.

### Configure the view of a widget (for work package tables)

You can configure the view of a work package widget to have the information included that you need.


<div class="glossary“>

**Work package** is a subset of a project that can be assigned to users for execution, such as Tasks, Bugs, User Storys, Milestones, and more. Work packages have a type, an ID and a subject and may have additional attributes, such as assignee, responsible, story points or target version. Work packages are displayed in a projects timeline (unless they are filtered out in the timeline configuration) - either as milestone or as phase. In order to use the work packages, the work package module has to be activated in the project settings.

</div>

​           

On a work package widget, click the three dots and select **Configure view...**

You can configure the work package table (e.g. filter, group, highlight, sort) according to the [filter, sorting and grouping criteria for work packages](../../user-guide/work-packages/#work-package-table-configuration).
