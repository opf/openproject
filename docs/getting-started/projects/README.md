# Projects introduction

Get an introduction how to work with projects in OpenProject. To start collaboration in OpenProject, you first have to set up a new project.

<div class="glossary">
A **project** is defined as a temporary, goal-driven effort to create a unique output. A project has clearly defined phases, a start and an end date, and its success is measured by whether it meets its stated objectives.
A project in OpenProject can be understood as a project as defined above. Also, it can be set up as a "workspace" for teams to collaborate on one common topic, e.g. to organize a department.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
**Note**: In order to see a project and work in it, you have to be a [member of a project](../invite-members).
